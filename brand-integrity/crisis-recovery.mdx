### 9. Crisis and Recovery Framework

The Crisis and Recovery Framework exists to protect IBBE's credibility when brand
integrity is compromised. Every deviation, whether visual, verbal, or ethical, triggers an
immediate structured response. The goal is restoration of accuracy, prevention of
recurrence, and reinforcement of trust.

#### 1. Detection

**Trigger Sources:**
- Automated monitoring system within the Brand Integrity Unit (BIU).
- Internal report submitted by officers or trustees.
- External complaint received from partners, press, or public channels.

**Immediate Actions:**
- The affected content or statement is frozen across all platforms.
- Metadata, access trails, and post history are captured for record.
- The responsible division receives a formal alert within one hour.
- A holding message appears in the system reading, "Under review for tone or
  factual deviation."

#### 2. Investigation

**Handled by:**
Joint panel composed of the Brand Integrity Unit (BIU) and the Ethics and Compliance
Unit (ECU).

**Steps:**
Review all related evidence including caption drafts, design files, internal
communication, and publishing logs.
Identify the root source: human error, unauthorized post, or external breach.

**Determine severity:**
1. Level 1 – Tone drift or visual deviation.
2. Level 2 – Misleading or exaggerated statement.
3. Level 3 – Data breach, falsified record, or ethical violation.

**Objective:**
The investigation focuses on factual restoration and intent verification. Evaluation centers
on the degree of trust impact, not personal blame.

#### 3. Correction

**Level 1 (Tone Drift):**
Content is removed immediately and reissued with revised language. The responsible
officer completes an internal tone review.

**Level 2 (Misrepresentation):**
Formal advisory issued to the concerned division. Public correction is mandatory. Visual
or post is replaced with a verified clarification marked "Corrected Version."

**Level 3 (Breach or False Data):**
Public disclosure released within twenty-four hours. All access credentials are reviewed
and reset. The BIU and ECU jointly issue an Integrity Bulletin documenting the case for the
quarterly audit.

The central aim of correction is not punishment but restoration of moral accuracy.

#### 4. Revalidation

Revised materials enter a full Brand Integrity Unit review cycle. All involved officers
undergo the Integrity Revalidation Module, which includes refresher training on tone
discipline and factual verification. Final approval comes from the Chief of Brand Integrity
and the Vice President (People and Culture).

The reissued post or campaign is logged in assets.ibbe.in with a "Restored Compliance"
tag and permanent timestamp.

#### 5. Public Apology Protocol

The tone of an IBBE apology remains humorous, dry, and factual. The purpose is to
communicate correction through intelligence and humility, never through sentiment or
defense.

**Structure:**

- **Headline:**
  Concise, self-aware, factual.
  Example: "We Tripped Over Our Own Standards (Fixed It)."
- **Admission:**
  One-line acknowledgment.
  Example: "A post earlier today overstated our program's reach. Our calculator now
  agrees with reality."
- **Correction:**
  Direct statement of resolution.
  Example: "The corrected version is live and verified by the Brand Integrity Unit."
- **Tone Close:**
  Brief reflection without drama.
  Example: "Appreciation to those who value precision as much as we do."

**Example Template:**

Subject: We Got It Wrong (and Made It Right)

Earlier this week, a post mentioned figures that failed internal accuracy review.

The corrected version is now active and verified across all related channels.

No drama, no spin, only precision restored.

#### 6. Reflection Clause

Every violation, once resolved, becomes a teaching case in the Brand Integrity Unit
archive. Anonymized summaries of incidents are presented during quarterly reviews to
division heads and creative teams. These reviews strengthen internal awareness and
reinforce IBBE's tone discipline.

Each crisis, when handled correctly, evolves into a lesson in integrity. Through this
framework, the organization ensures that every error leads to greater clarity,
accountability, and trust.
