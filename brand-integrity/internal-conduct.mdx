### 5. Internal Brand Conduct

Every member of IBBE serves as the living reflection of its philosophy. The Clause of
Collective Conscience defines that the brand breathes through its people. Every action,
tone, and message carries the institution's reputation. Discipline, empathy, and precision
are expected in every interaction.

Communication inside and outside the organization must always remain factual and clear.
Words should inform, not persuade through emotion. The strength of IBBE lies in how
calmly and truthfully it expresses itself. Each sentence must represent understanding, not
performance.

Transparency functions as a virtue only when balanced with respect for boundaries.
Employees are encouraged to communicate truthfully while protecting sensitive data,
internal operations, and unpublished projects. Sharing information for personal validation
or visibility is considered a violation of trust.

All public communication involving IBBE—including interviews, online commentary, or
media references—requires prior clearance from the Brand Integrity Unit. This ensures
consistency in voice, accuracy in message, and protection of brand ethics. Personal
views must never appear as institutional positions.

Every visual, written, or digital asset must pass through an approval chain before
publication. Division leads verify factual content, while the Brand Integrity Unit confirms
tone, design, and alignment with official standards. Publication proceeds only after both
approvals are formally recorded.

Artificial intelligence–generated content is banned across all forms of IBBE production.
This includes text, visuals, and video. The organization upholds human creativity as
sacred craft. Each sentence, illustration, or motion design must originate from authentic
human effort. The reason for this policy is simple: IBBE values human art as a form of
consciousness that technology cannot replicate. The imperfections of human work create
sincerity, and sincerity sustains trust.

Every person in the organization, from officer to founder, bears equal responsibility for
maintaining this standard. Conduct defines credibility more powerfully than statement. To
represent IBBE is to embody its discipline in tone, integrity in communication, and
reverence for human originality.
