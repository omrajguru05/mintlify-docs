### 6. Brand Protection and Usage

The IBBE identity stands as intellectual property of the highest order. Every symbol, color,
phrase, and document created within this ecosystem belongs to the institution.
Ownership exists to preserve meaning. Every creative element carries legal protection
and moral responsibility.

#### Logo and Asset Usage

The IBBE logo and all official marks may be used only by verified officers, program
managers, and institutional partners with active certification. Unauthorized reproduction,
adaptation, or placement constitutes an infringement of internal charter. Access is
granted exclusively through secured repositories within the IBBE digital ecosystem.

Logos must appear only in approved formats and color codes. Alteration, replication
through external software, or stylistic modification is prohibited. The mark functions as a
seal of truth, and its use demands precision. The symbol may appear only in institutional,
educational, or officially sanctioned environments. Any other setting requires written
approval from the Brand Integrity Unit.

#### Legal Ownership and Licensing

All IBBE assets—including documents, training materials, brand files, digital interfaces, and
visual compositions—remain under permanent intellectual ownership of the institution.
Authorship credit is preserved for individual creators, but full licensing rights belong to
IBBE under internal law. Redistribution, storage, or publication on any external platform
requires written authorization from the central legal division.

Each official document is embedded with a digital watermark and verified through secure
ledger tracking. The watermark confirms authenticity and ownership while enabling
real-time tracing of duplication or misuse. Unauthorized copies, screenshots, or
extractions will trigger automated alerts followed by immediate legal intervention. Every
employee and partner acknowledges this clause upon onboarding.

#### Co-Branding Rules

Partnership entities such as schools, clusters, and corporate collaborators may display
the IBBE mark only under written agreement. The mark must always appear secondary in
visual hierarchy, placed beside the partner identity with approved spacing and proportion.
Size equality with the partner logo requires explicit clearance from the Brand Integrity
Unit.

Co-branded materials must maintain consistency in tone, layout, and message. All
campaigns, brochures, and digital assets that carry the IBBE emblem must undergo two
rounds of review—brand compliance followed by legal approval. Any deviation from format
or color standard constitutes an ethical breach and may result in contract suspension.

#### Digital Watermarking and Anti-Leak Mechanisms

Every digital file issued from the IBBE ecosystem carries unique traceable metadata,
recorded at the point of download or access. Watermarking extends across visible and
invisible layers to safeguard against duplication. Automated protection systems monitor
data flow within internal channels and flag any irregular transfer.

Confidential materials remain accessible through encrypted vaults under time-bound
permissions. Sharing links expire automatically after verification periods. Each access
request is logged and reviewed during quarterly audits. Violations lead to permanent
access removal, role termination, and potential legal prosecution.

Brand protection within IBBE equals cultural preservation. Every element of the brand
exists to communicate trust, and every unauthorized use erodes that foundation. The
mark is more than a logo; it is a declaration of integrity. Each officer is entrusted with its
defense as a matter of personal honor.
