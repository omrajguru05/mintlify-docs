### 8. Brand Integrity Unit

The Brand Integrity Unit safeguards the truth of IBBE's external image. It functions as the
guardian of tone, design, and narrative accuracy. Every element that carries the IBBE
name must pass through this system before public release. The unit ensures that what the
world sees reflects the values the organization lives by—clarity, respect, and
craftsmanship.

#### 1. Purpose and Jurisdiction

**Mandate:**
Protect and preserve IBBE's external perception through disciplined oversight of every
creative, communicative, and AI-assisted output before release.

**Scope:**
Applies to all visual, linguistic, and digital materials created for public or institutional use.
The jurisdiction extends to websites, campaigns, press visuals, social media, and
keynotes.

**Authority:**
Holds equal authority to the Ethics and Compliance Unit. Reports directly to the Vice
President (People and Culture) and the President. Possesses full decision-making power
on brand-related standards. Its decisions are final in all matters related to design, tone,
and representation.

#### 2. Core Structure

**1. Chief of Brand Integrity (CBI)**

Leads the entire unit and defines what qualifies as "on-brand." Approves all final
campaigns, press visuals, and keynote presentations. Holds veto power over tone,
visual identity, or storytelling that deviates from IBBE's standard. Works with the
Ethics and Compliance Unit to resolve representation violations or tone breaches.

**2. Brand Verification Division (BVD)**

Ensures every visual adheres to IBBE's design structure. Verifies logos, templates,
typography, motion purpose, and color consistency. Checks for watermark
integrity and audits the use of IBBE marks by partner schools, clusters, and media
affiliates. Maintains the master archive of design approvals.

**3. Language and Narrative Division (LND)**

Reviews all text-based communication including captions, emails, brochures, and
keynote scripts. Screens for banned phrasing patterns such as "not only but,"
emotional overstatement, and promotional exaggeration. Maintains the official IBBE
Tone and Voice Database, which includes approved phrasing for public, internal,
and academic use.

**4. AI and Digital Media Oversight Cell (ADOC)**

Monitors and regulates all AI-related activity. Confirms that no AI-generated text,
video, or image is released under IBBE's name. Reviews internal drafts created with
digital tools for compliance before clearance. Tracks metadata and watermark
signatures in every output to ensure originality.

**5. Campaign Review Council (CRC)**

A temporary committee formed for each major campaign. Includes members from
Marketing, Relations, and Ethics divisions. Conducts the final evaluation of
campaigns, verifying tone alignment, emotional integrity, and humor balance
before public launch.

#### 3. Workflow

- **Submission:**
  All public material must be sent to omrajguru@ibbe.in or submitted through the
  internal review dashboard.
- **Pre-Check:**
  An automated form categorizes the submission as visual, narrative, or AI-assisted
  for routing.
- **Review Cycle:**
  The BVD, LND, and ADOC complete an integrated review within 48 hours.
- **Feedback Loop:**
  The reviewing team issues structured comments using official codes such as
  "Tone Drift," "Visual Deviation," or "Moral Clarity Gap."
- **Approval or Rework:**
  The Chief of Brand Integrity grants final clearance. Only after sign-off can any
  material reach public channels.
- **Archival:**
  Each approved version is timestamped, coded, and stored in assets.ibbe.in for
  traceability.

#### 4. Enforcement Powers

The Brand Integrity Unit can pause, withdraw, or recall any material that violates tone,
language, or design standards. It holds the right to request retraction of external
publications if brand misrepresentation occurs. Repeated breaches result in collaboration
with the Ethics and Compliance Unit for disciplinary action.

Quarterly Integrity Reports are released to summarize approvals, rejections, detected
violations, and learnings. These reports act as internal performance audits and cultural
calibration tools.

#### 5. Philosophy

The purpose of the Brand Integrity Unit is preservation, not censorship. It exists to ensure
that the essence of IBBE remains intact across every medium. Its guiding belief is that a
brand's soul fades first in tone and then in truth. Every phrase, image, and pixel must
trace back to a deliberate act of human intention. The work must remain clean in logic,
calm in energy, and human in expression.
