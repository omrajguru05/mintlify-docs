### 3. Brand System Overview

The IBBE identity is designed to embody clarity and restraint. Every visual element carries
precision and quiet authority. Nothing is ornamental; everything serves structure,
emotion, or meaning. The visual system is built to be timeless and repeatable, ensuring
that every form of communication feels consistent, intelligent, and alive with intention.

#### Logos and Marks

The IBBE logo is a symbol of discipline, wellness, and education. It merges three ideas
into one form: a person, a book, and a graduation cap—representing human growth
through learning. The upper structure forms the cap, the middle suggests open pages,
and the base symbolizes human balance and support. This blend of geometry and
emotion creates a mark that feels both institutional and humane.

The logo must always appear in full integrity, never cropped, stretched, or recolored. Only
black and white variants are approved. Transparent backgrounds are mandatory in all
digital and print use. The minimum digital size is 32 pixels; the minimum print size is 1.2
centimeters. Placement must always follow a structured grid, centered or left-aligned with
proportional spacing. The clear space around the logo must equal the height of the letter
"I" to preserve balance and visibility. The logo exists to signify authorship, not to demand
attention.

#### Color Palette

The color palette of IBBE draws from grounded, human tones that reflect the
organization's calm precision.

**Charcoal Black (#1A1A1A)** represents authority and timeless focus. It gives weight to text
and stability to design.

**Bone White (#F5F3EE)** is the foundation—an open, clean surface representing truth and
transparency.

**Warm Cream (#E9E3D4)** introduces warmth into structure, balancing intellect with
empathy.

**Deep Ochre (#C2A46D)** and **Muted Copper (#B38A5E)** act as refined accents, adding
craft and heritage to digital and printed compositions.

**Slate Gray (#4B4B4B)** and **Soft Beige (#D9CAB3)** define transitions, creating visual
hierarchy and quiet rhythm.

**Electric Pearl (#D7F0FF)** is reserved only for interactive moments, used sparingly to
express motion or focus.

Each tone is part of a deliberate system of emotion and function. Colors exist to
communicate stability, never excess. They should appear as natural extensions of the
content, not as decoration.

#### Typography

Typography carries the brand's voice and composure. IBBE uses the Inter family as its
primary font, chosen for its geometric clarity and human balance. Inter Display or Bold
defines headers with authority, Medium supports subheadings with measured emphasis,
and Regular or Light is used for body text to ensure legibility and flow. Spacing between
lines is generous, allowing air and rhythm in composition.

Legacy typography such as Poppins and Times New Roman may appear in archival or
transitional contexts but are not used in the new system. All textual communication must
appear unembellished, refined, and aligned to the hierarchy of meaning rather than size
alone. Typography should feel intentional, never loud.

#### Imagery and Creative Direction

Images should convey structure and intellect. Use compact, cathedral-like compositions
that capture height, symmetry, and balance. Every image must be high quality, modern,
and approved by the Brand Integrity Unit. Avoid outdated, filtered, or low-resolution
visuals.

IBBE imagery remains monochrome, built on fine geometric line work and mathematical
proportion. Each illustration or photograph reflects the idea of harmony—representing how
education can be both technical and soulful. Texture is minimal, relying on light and
shadow to create presence. The goal is calm intelligence, not spectacle.

Iconography must follow the same discipline. Use only fine-stroke icons that are
transparent and minimal. Avoid colored, filled, or thick-stroked icons that break the visual
language. Icons function as structural elements of thought, not visual fillers.

#### Brand Tone and Motion

The brand tone remains consistent across every medium—measured, respectful, and
precise. Motion design follows a single rule: movement exists to clarify hierarchy and
focus. GSAP defines transitions with organic pacing that feels natural and fluid. Three.js
adds dimensional depth and subtle reflection, giving digital experiences the impression of
transparency and honesty.

Animations are never decorative. Every motion should guide the eye, reveal a layer of
meaning, or teach hierarchy. Each transition carries intent, and every pause has weight.
This is how digital movement becomes a continuation of brand ethics: quiet precision
expressed through motion.
