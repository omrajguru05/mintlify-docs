## Definition

Every person who interacts with anything our company owns or operates holds complete authority over their own experience, with the sole exception of records and communications required by law, academic integrity, or account security.

## Scopes

### Category A: Product and Platform

**Scope 1: Interface and Layout Customization**
Every section, module, widget, and content block on the LMS platform is repositionable, hideable, or removable by the user. The company provides a default layout as a starting template only.

*Example: A student sees a short video section above a long video section by default. They prefer long-form content and move the long video section to the top, permanently removing the short video section from their view.*

---

**Scope 2: Learning Path and Pace**
Users control the sequence and pace of their learning where the academic contract with their institution permits. Self-paced learners may reorder content, skip ahead, or revisit modules freely.

*Example: A self-enrolled learner reorders course modules to study advanced topics first, then revisits foundational content later at their own discretion.*

---

**Scope 3: Website Content and Feature Visibility**
Any section on company-owned websites including landing pages, blogs, and resource hubs is configurable per user preference. Recommendation engines, suggested content feeds, and promotional banners are all opt-in.

*Example: A returning user turns off the recommended courses banner and disables the trending content section, seeing only the core navigation they use.*

---

### Category B: Marketing and Communications

**Scope 1: Email**
The company default for all marketing communication is zero contact. Users receive only transactional and security emails unless they explicitly opt into specific communication categories. Each category is independently selectable and withdrawable at any time with immediate effect.

*Example: A user signs up for the LMS and receives only a welcome email and account confirmation. Later they choose to opt into the monthly newsletter but leave all promotional emails off.*

---

**Scope 2: Push Notifications**
Users control every category of push notification independently. Notification frequency, timing preferences, and topic categories are all user-defined. The company sends nothing beyond critical security alerts unless invited.

*Example: A student sets notifications to receive only assignment deadline reminders and disables all platform update and promotional notifications.*

---

**Scope 3: Advertising**
The company runs zero advertisements across all its products and platforms. No third-party advertising, retargeting, or sponsored content appears anywhere the company operates. This is a permanent company stance.

*Example: A student using the LMS at no point sees any third-party ad, sponsored recommendation, or promoted content from any advertiser, ever.*

---

### Category C: Support and Engagement

**Scope 1: Support Channel and Style**
Users select their preferred support channel and communication style. Proactive outreach from the support team is opt-in only. Users who prefer to reach out on their own terms are never contacted proactively.

*Example: A user sets their support preference to email only with a formal communication style and opts out of proactive check-ins. The support team honors this fully.*

---

**Scope 2: Data and Personalization**
Users decide what data shapes their experience, what behavioral data is retained, and what is discarded. Personalization engines are opt-in. Users may reset their preference profile at any time.

*Example: A user opts out of behavioral tracking entirely. The platform stops using their activity data for recommendations and resets their personalization profile to neutral defaults.*

## Fixed Layer: What Remains Non-Negotiable

The following elements are exempt from user modification. They exist to serve legal compliance, academic integrity, or account security. These exemptions are transparent, minimal, and consistently applied.

| Fixed Element | Reason |
|---|---|
| Course progress and grades | Required for institutional compliance, accreditation, and credential verification |
| Transactional emails | Legally required receipts, invoices, and payment confirmations |
| Account security communications | Password resets, login alerts, and critical account notices |
| Legal disclosures | Mandatory terms, privacy notices, and regulatory requirements |
| Institutional academic requirements | Assigned coursework and integrity tools defined by institutional contracts |

## Why This Policy Matters

The education technology market has long defaulted to engagement-maximization models that prioritize platform metrics over learner wellbeing. The User Sovereignty Law is a deliberate departure from that model.

Trust is the foundation of learning. When users feel controlled by a platform rather than served by it, engagement becomes hollow and retention suffers. By giving users genuine authority over their own experience, the company builds a relationship based on value rather than dependency.

This policy is also a direct competitive differentiator. Educators, students, and institutions are increasingly aware of how platforms exploit attention. A company that makes sovereignty a formal, documented, and enforceable law stands apart from every major player in the EdTech space.

Finally, this policy creates internal discipline. Every product decision, every marketing campaign, and every support workflow must pass through one question: does this respect the user's authority over their experience? That question, asked consistently, produces better products and a more trusted brand.
