# Advertising and Commercial Placement Policy

**Policy Number:** POL-ADV-001
**Effective Date:** Immediately upon issuance
**Applies To:** All entities, platforms, channels, and products operating under the parent company group
**Issued By:** Office of the Founding Team
**Review Cycle:** Annual or upon material change in business operations

---

## 1. Purpose

This Policy establishes a uniform standard governing the use, prohibition, and governance of advertising and commercial placements across all platforms, channels, and communications operated by the company group. The foundational purpose of this Policy is to protect the trust relationship between the company and its learners, which constitutes the core asset of the education business.

---

## 2. Scope

This Policy applies to:

- All digital platforms operated by the company group, including but limited to YouTube channels, Learning Management System (LMS) platforms, websites, mobile applications, and newsletters
- All personnel, including employees, contractors, content creators, and channel managers operating on behalf of any entity within the group
- All intercompany promotional arrangements between entities sharing the same parent company

---

## 3. Definition of Advertising

For the purposes of this Policy, **advertising** is defined as:

> Any content, placement, recommendation, or communication whose visibility, positioning, or inclusion within a platform or channel was determined, in whole or in part, by a commercial agreement, financial transaction, or preferential arrangement, regardless of the identity of the sponsoring party.

The defining criterion is the **mechanism of placement**, not the identity of the sponsor. Content placed due to payment or commercial arrangement constitutes advertising under this Policy, whether the sponsor is a third party, a sister company, or another division of the same parent group.

---

## 4. Permitted Scope

The following categories of content are expressly permitted under this Policy.

### 4.1 Algorithmic Recommendations

**Description:** Content, courses, tools, or resources surfaced to a learner by a platform algorithm based solely on learner behavior, engagement data, and relevance signals, with no commercial consideration influencing placement.

**Illustrative Examples:**
- An LMS recommending an advanced course upon completion of a foundational one, based on learner progression data
- A platform surfacing a related course from a sister company because the algorithm identified a genuine curriculum fit
- A YouTube channel's recommendation engine surfacing a related educational video based on viewer history

**Rationale:** Algorithmic recommendations serve the learner's educational journey. No commercial motive determines their placement. These recommendations are operationally and ethically distinct from advertising and are a legitimate product function.

### 4.2 Own-Platform Product Communication

**Description:** Announcements or communications by any group entity to its own existing user base regarding its own products, services, or platform updates, delivered through channels owned by that same entity.

**Illustrative Examples:**
- A YouTube channel announcing the launch of its own LMS to existing subscribers
- An LMS notifying enrolled students of a newly available course category on the same platform
- An email to registered users informing them of a platform feature update

**Rationale:** Communicating product developments to an existing audience within owned channels is standard operational communication. The audience has consented to that relationship, and the communication is directly relevant to why they are engaged with the platform.

### 4.3 Editorial and Pedagogical Recommendations

**Description:** Recommendations of tools, resources, books, or external materials made by instructors or editorial staff based solely on educational merit and curriculum relevance, with no commercial arrangement influencing the recommendation.

**Illustrative Examples:**
- An instructor recommending a specific software tool because it is the industry standard for the subject being taught
- A course curriculum referencing a publicly available resource because it is the most pedagogically appropriate material
- An editorial team curating a reading list based on academic quality

**Rationale:** Educator judgment and curriculum integrity are central to the company's mission. Recommendations grounded in educational merit, free of commercial influence, are a core pedagogical function and must remain unrestricted.

## 5. Prohibited Scope

The following categories are expressly prohibited under this Policy. No exception may be made without formal written approval from the founding team.

### 5.1 Third-Party Advertising

**Description:** Any paid placement, sponsorship, or commercial arrangement with entities external to the parent company group, including but not limited to display advertising, video pre-roll, sponsored content, affiliate links, brand integrations, and influencer-style paid promotions.

**Illustrative Examples:**
- Enabling Google AdSense or any third-party ad network on a platform or YouTube channel
- Accepting payment from an external brand in exchange for a mention, review, or placement within course content
- Including affiliate links to external products within learning materials or platform interfaces

**Rationale:** Third-party advertising inserts commercial motives into the learning environment. A learner who encounters an external brand advertisement within a learning context has reasonable grounds to question whether surrounding content was influenced by similar commercial arrangements. This erosion of perceived objectivity directly undermines the trust relationship upon which the company's value is founded.

### 5.2 Paid Intercompany Promotion

**Description:** Any promotional placement of a sister company's products or services on a group platform that was determined by a financial transaction, internal commercial agreement, or preferential corporate arrangement rather than learner relevance.

**Illustrative Examples:**
- A group entity paying or negotiating placement to have its product featured on the company's LMS dashboard
- A sister company's product appearing in a promotional banner on the platform because of a corporate-level revenue sharing agreement
- Course completion emails featuring a sister company's offering due to an internal commercial arrangement rather than genuine educational relevance

**Rationale:** The corporate relationship between entities within the group is invisible to learners. A learner cannot distinguish between a genuine recommendation and a commercially motivated intercompany placement. The functional impact on learner trust is identical to third-party advertising, and the prohibition applies equally.

### 5.3 Sponsored Content Presented as Educational Material

**Description:** Any lesson, video, article, guide, assessment, or other learning material whose content, structure, or conclusions were shaped, funded, or directed by a commercial sponsor, regardless of whether sponsorship is disclosed.

**Illustrative Examples:**
- A "tutorial" on a software tool that was funded by that tool's vendor and presents the tool more favorably than an independent assessment would
- A study guide that prominently features a sponsor's product as the recommended solution to a problem addressed in the curriculum
- A guest lecture arranged through a commercial agreement rather than on the basis of the speaker's educational credentials

**Rationale:** This is the most severe category of prohibited conduct under this Policy. Sponsored educational material corrupts the integrity of the learning experience at its source. Even with disclosure, a learner who knows that course content was commercially influenced has lost confidence in the objectivity of the education being received. This outcome is irreconcilable with the company's mission.

### 5.4 Irrelevant Intercompany Cross-Promotion

**Description:** Active promotion of a sister company's product or service to learners where the promoted offering has no genuine relevance to the learner's educational journey, regardless of whether a formal financial arrangement exists.

**Illustrative Examples:**
- A fintech product owned by the parent group being featured on the LMS home dashboard with no educational relevance
- A push notification sent to learners promoting a sister company's consumer product unrelated to education
- An end-of-course screen directing learners to a group entity's non-education service

**Rationale:** Even absent a formal financial transaction, promotions driven by corporate relationship rather than learner relevance function as advertising in their effect on the learner. The learner's educational context is being used as a commercial channel. This violates the foundational principle that the platform exists to serve the learner's educational goals.

## 6. Governing Principle

All decisions regarding content placement, recommendations, and communications on company platforms shall be evaluated against the following test:

> **Was the placement of this content determined by its relevance to the learner, or by a commercial consideration?**

If the answer is commercial consideration, the placement is prohibited under this Policy.

---

## 7. Compliance and Enforcement

All personnel and entities subject to this Policy are required to ensure full compliance from the effective date. Any existing arrangements that conflict with this Policy must be terminated or restructured to achieve compliance. Suspected violations may be reported to the founding team. Material or repeated violations will be treated as a breach of the company's core operating principles.

---

## 8. Policy Review

This Policy shall be reviewed annually. Amendments require approval from the founding team and take effect upon formal issuance of an updated version bearing a revised effective date.

---

*This Policy is issued on behalf of the company group and supersedes any prior informal understandings or arrangements regarding advertising and commercial placements across group platforms.*
