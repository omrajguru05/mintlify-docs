### 4. The Ethics Cycle

Every principle of conduct at IBBE is upheld through a four-stage process designed to
protect dignity while restoring discipline. Ethics here is not reactive policing — it is
preventive architecture. The goal is not to punish mistakes but to preserve standards,
ensuring the organization never drifts from its moral axis.

#### Stage 1: Observation

Every potential violation begins with observation — a calm, factual record of behavior that
appears inconsistent with IBBE's values or operational expectations. Observation is not
accusation; it is documentation.

- Any officer, coordinator, or leader may file an observation through the internal
reporting channel.
- Observations must include time, date, context, and evidence (message, file, or
report).
- Anonymous submissions are accepted only if supported by verifiable data.
- Speculation, gossip, or emotional framing invalidate the entry.

Once logged, the observation is time-stamped and forwarded to the Ethics & Compliance
Unit (ECU) for preliminary review.

#### Stage 2: Dialogue

The ECU initiates a private, structured dialogue with the concerned individual. This stage
aims for clarity, not confrontation.

- Both sides present verified facts within a 48-hour window.
- Tone remains factual and non-performative; emotional arguments or appeals to
hierarchy are not considered.
- If the issue arises from misunderstanding, improper communication, or minor
deviation, verbal correction and notation close the case.
- If deeper intent or repetition is found, the case advances to correction.

Dialogue is where most issues are resolved — through honesty, accountability, and
humility. The capacity to admit error calmly is treated as a sign of maturity, not weakness.

#### Stage 3: Correction

When a deviation has caused tangible disruption, the ECU issues a formal correction
directive. This is not punishment; it is structured accountability.

- The individual receives a written statement outlining the deviation, expected
correction, and review period (usually 7–14 days).
- During this period, the member continues duties under observation and is required
to submit a Corrective Reflection Note — summarizing what was learned, what
changes will be made, and how trust will be restored.
- A senior member may be appointed as a mentor for the correction phase, ensuring
support without bias.
- Repeated disregard for correction or defensive conduct escalates the case to
disciplinary review.

Correction is measured by change, not apology. The standard is met when behavior
aligns with culture, not when regret is expressed.

#### Stage 4: Restoration

Once correction has been achieved, the process moves toward restoration — the formal
reinstatement of full trust.

- The ECU reviews evidence of improvement, including peer feedback and task
performance.
- If alignment is consistent, the member is officially reinstated and the case is
marked "Restored."
- The reinstatement note remains confidential and internal; no public mention or
announcement is permitted.
- If the breach was serious but forgiven, future leadership eligibility may still require
a probationary interval.

Restoration is the end of the process — a quiet return to standard. Humiliation, gossip, or
public correction are prohibited under any circumstance. Dignity is non-negotiable, even
in discipline.

#### Confidential Recordkeeping

Every ethical case — from observation to restoration — is archived within the Compliance
Vault, the secure internal database governed jointly by the Ethics & Compliance Unit
(ECU) and the President's Office.

- Each case is assigned a code (e.g., ECU-2025-04-B12) for internal tracking.
- Access is limited to the ECU, the President, and the Vice President (People &
Culture).
- Quarterly audits review anonymized patterns to identify recurring issues and
improve training, not to shame individuals.

Ethics at IBBE is a process of refinement — a mirror polished through accountability.
Restoration, not humiliation, remains the only acceptable outcome.
