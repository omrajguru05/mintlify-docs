### 6. Restoration and Return Protocol

Restoration at IBBE is a process of rebuilding trust — not a second chance, but a
re-earned place. The organization believes that discipline and mercy can coexist when
sincerity is proven through behavior, not words. The path back is structured, confidential,
and deeply demanding.

#### Eligibility for Restoration

A member becomes eligible for restoration only when:

- The breach is deemed recoverable by the Ethics & Compliance Unit (ECU).
- The individual accepts full responsibility without justification or blame.
- A sustained period of corrected conduct is observed — typically 30 to 60 days.
- The original infraction involved error in judgment, not intent to deceive or harm.

If these conditions are met, the ECU begins the Reintegration Review Process, evaluating
whether the individual can safely return to operational duties.

#### Assessment & Approval Process

1. **Behavioral Review:**
The ECU reviews logs, peer reports, and supervisor feedback to verify
consistency in attitude, performance, and communication during the correction
phase.

2. **Reflective Interview:**
A private dialogue is conducted with the individual to assess understanding of the
violation, personal accountability, and readiness to rejoin.

3. **Cultural Alignment Test:**
The member must demonstrate clear comprehension of IBBE's tone, behavioral
ethics, and reporting discipline.

4. **Decision:**
If alignment is confirmed, re-entry is formally approved by the ECU and validated
by the Vice President, People & Culture.

All decisions are recorded in the Compliance Vault under the "Restoration" log,
maintaining transparency without exposure.

#### Reflective Training Module

Before reinstatement, every returning member must complete the Reflective Training
Module — a short, self-paced internal course designed to reinforce moral clarity and
cultural discipline.

The module includes:

- **Ethics Reorientation:** Understanding how small actions affect institutional trust.
- **Communication Refinement:** Practicing restraint, precision, and brand-aligned
tone.
- **Accountability Drill:** Writing a Reflective Memorandum — a written personal
statement detailing the lessons learned, actions taken, and future conduct
commitments.
- **Verification Quiz:** A short evaluation confirming comprehension of the Business
Conduct Charter and Core Principles of Conduct.

Completion of this module is mandatory for system reactivation and restoration of access
rights.

#### Re-Signing the Conduct Charter

Upon successful completion of training, the member must digitally re-sign the IBBE
Conduct Charter.

This reaffirms:

- Commitment to institutional discipline and humility.
- Understanding of response-time standards and reporting hierarchy.
- Agreement to confidentiality and brand representation clauses.

The signature marks the official reinstatement of position and privileges.

#### Privacy and Communication Protocol

Restoration is a private process.

- No announcements, group acknowledgments, or public statements are permitted.
- Supervisors are informed quietly through internal notice.
- The restored member is expected to return to duty without discussion or reference
to prior events.

Any attempt to dramatize or publicize the process nullifies reinstatement.

#### Monitoring and Follow-Up

For a period of 60 days following restoration, the member operates under a mentorship
system:

- Weekly progress updates are submitted to the assigned mentor.
- The mentor tracks behavioral alignment, consistency, and work quality.
- The ECU conducts a final review at the end of the monitoring period and, if
performance remains stable, closes the case permanently.

Restoration does not erase history — it redeems it through discipline.

#### Philosophy of Return

IBBE believes that redemption strengthens culture when handled with dignity. A mistake is
forgivable only when it becomes a lesson shared through silence and work ethic.
True restoration is not a return to status, but a return to standard — the point where
humility and discipline meet.
