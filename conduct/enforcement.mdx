### 5. Enforcement Structure

Ethical enforcement at IBBE exists to preserve order, not to intimidate. The process is
structured, traceable, and deeply humane — ensuring that correction restores dignity
rather than erodes it. Every action, whether a simple advisory or a termination, follows
written procedure and moral restraint.

#### Primary Oversight

All enforcement actions are governed by the Ethics & Compliance Unit (ECU).
The ECU functions as the moral judiciary of IBBE — independent, confidential, and bound
by precision.

Its responsibilities include:

- Reviewing reported or observed violations.
- Conducting investigations with verifiable evidence.
- Ensuring the right to be heard before judgment.
- Recording every action in the Compliance Vault.
- Recommending cultural or procedural reforms when patterns emerge.

No disciplinary action may proceed without the ECU's written authorization.

#### Operational Linkage

The Brand Integrity Unit (BIU) acts in tandem with the ECU for matters that affect IBBE's
public image, external representation, or communication standards.

- The BIU intervenes when violations relate to tone, public statements, social media,
branding, or partner communication.
- It collaborates with the ECU to ensure that corrective actions preserve both moral
and representational integrity.
- Public clarifications, if required, are drafted exclusively by the BIU and approved by
the President's Office before release.

The BIU's mandate is to repair its reputation without spectacle. All external responses
must remain dry, factual, and free of emotional framing.

#### Action Levels

Enforcement is tiered into four clear levels, based on severity, intent, and recoverability
of trust.

**1. Advisory Notice — Tone Deviation or Miscommunication**

Issued for minor infractions such as unprofessional tone, delayed response, or misaligned
representation.

- Delivered privately by the ECU or Division Chief.
- Recorded as an informal note, not a disciplinary mark.
- Followed by a reflection meeting within 48 hours.

Repeated advisories escalate to a formal written warning.

**2. Written Warning — Breach of Duty or Trust**

Applied when an individual disregards responsibilities, delays without reason, or displays
avoidable negligence.

- Issued in writing with timestamp, evidence, and behavioral context.
- The recipient must submit a corrective plan within seven days.
- The warning remains on record for six months and may influence promotion or
eligibility.

Failure to demonstrate visible correction advances the case to suspension.

**3. Temporary Suspension — Severe Misconduct or Negligence**

Applied when conduct causes measurable harm to trust, confidentiality, or institutional
order.

- Duration: typically 7–30 days, based on severity.
- During suspension, access to internal systems is paused and duties reassigned.
- The member must complete a corrective training module and submit a
reinstatement request reviewed by the ECU.
- The suspension is logged permanently but marked Resolved upon verified
improvement.

A suspended member may not represent IBBE in any internal or external capacity until
clearance.

**4. Termination — Irreversible Breach or Repeated Violation**

Applied when misconduct shows intent, repetition, or reputational damage beyond
recovery.

- Decision made by a three-member review panel (ECU Head, VP of People &
Culture, and the President).
- The terminated member receives a detailed report outlining cause and due
process followed.
- All digital access is revoked within 24 hours.
- The decision is final but eligible for one appeal within seven days.

Termination is executed silently — no announcements, no public reference, no
humiliation.

#### Appeals Framework

Every individual subject to disciplinary action retains the right to one formal appeal.

- Appeals must be submitted in writing to the ECU within seven working days of the
notice.
- The appeal should include a factual statement, supporting evidence, and
corrective intent.
- The ECU must review and conclude within ten working days.
- If approved, the individual enters a monitored restoration phase under mentorship
for a fixed period.

If denied, the record stands closed and archived in the Compliance Vault.

#### Philosophy of Enforcement

Enforcement at IBBE is not a hierarchy's weapon — it is a culture's immune system.
The purpose is clarity, not fear. Every warning is an invitation to mature; every correction,
a test of humility. The measure of character is not in avoiding mistakes but in how one
returns to standard after making them.
