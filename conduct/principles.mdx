### 3. Principles of Conduct

#### 3.1 Discipline Without Ego

**Definition:**
Discipline is the quiet act of doing what is right, even when unseen. It is the refusal to let
mood, fatigue, or opinion interfere with responsibility. Ego fades when the mission
becomes the only constant.

**Expectation:**

- Meet deadlines exactly as promised. Excuses are not part of professionalism.
- Follow hierarchies with composure; respect is expressed through response time,
not tone.
- Correction is never personal — it is alignment to standard.
- Consistent silence or delay is treated as neglect of duty.
- Grace under pressure is the highest proof of discipline.

**Internal Practice:**
Every officer is expected to respond to all official communication within two hours.
Escalations follow a defined chain: Officer → Coordinator → Division Chief → Board
Chief → Vice President → President.
When correction is issued, acknowledgment and adjustment are mandatory within
twenty-four hours.

#### 3.2 Transparency Without Oversharing

**Definition:**
Transparency means clarity without chaos. It ensures visibility where it matters and
silence where it protects. Oversharing, even with good intent, dilutes focus and threatens
confidentiality.

**Expectation:**

- Record and document all significant actions — decisions, approvals, and
communications — in the official workspace.
- Share updates upward through the reporting chain; avoid broadcasting unverified
information.
- Never leak drafts, private discussions, or internal screenshots.
- Protect pre-launch projects as if they were intellectual property — because they
are.

**Internal Practice:**
Every project lead must maintain a clear log of decisions with time stamps, accessible
only to their reporting manager. Conversations involving unreleased plans must stay
confined to internal systems. Members are expected to balance openness with restraint
— clarity of intent, economy of words, and respect for privacy.

#### 3.3 Loyalty to the Mission Over Personal Gain

**Definition:**
Personal ambition is valid only when it strengthens the organization's purpose. Loyalty is
not declared — it is proven when one acts in the brand's interest even when no one is
watching.

**Expectation:**

- No member may use IBBE's name, position, or materials for personal branding,
sponsorships, or deals without written authorization.
- Data, partnerships, and creative work produced under IBBE are institutional assets.
- Personal recognition follows collective success, never the other way around.
- Concealing external affiliations or conflicts of interest is considered ethical
misconduct.

**Internal Practice:**
Members must disclose side ventures or collaborations that might intersect with IBBE's
operations. Every tool, database, and relationship created within IBBE remains locked
under organizational custody. Recognition within IBBE is earned through consistency and
contribution, not visibility.

#### 3.4 Execution Over Explanation

**Definition:**
Ideas matter only when they materialize. Explanation without execution adds no value.
Action is the real language of belief.

**Expectation:**

- Replace commentary with completion; updates should include proof, not plans.
- Every deliverable must have tangible output — a written report, prototype, design,
or measurable result.
- Work must be traceable: if it cannot be verified, it does not exist.
- Long explanations are treated as substitutes for discipline, not signs of depth.

**Internal Practice:**
Progress is documented through "Proof of Work" entries, including submission date,
author, and verifiable file. Reports must focus on outcomes achieved, not intentions
discussed. Meetings end with deliverables, not declarations.

#### 3.5 Kindness Without Performance

**Definition:**
Kindness is a responsibility, not a show. It means treating others — and the system —
with quiet respect. Performed kindness is manipulation; genuine kindness builds stability.

**Expectation:**

- Treat deadlines with the same respect as people. Both deserve punctuality.
- Offer help privately; praise publicly; correct gently.
- Avoid selective empathy — fairness matters more than sentiment.
- Keep communication calm, factual, and free of dramatization.

**Internal Practice:**
Team communication must stay concise and emotionally neutral. Feedback should target
behavior, not personality. If a disagreement arises, resolve it in private conversation within
twenty-four hours. Kindness is measured not in words, but in the safety and clarity it
creates around work.
