# IBBE Core Principles of Conduct

## Manual

### 1. Introduction

The Core Principles of Conduct Manual defines the behavioral, ethical, and cultural
expectations that govern every officer, coordinator, intern, trustee, and partner operating
within IBBE. It exists to ensure that our internal actions carry the same precision and
discipline as the systems we design for the world. Conduct at IBBE is not a matter of
formality—it is the living proof of our philosophy that integrity, clarity, and excellence can
coexist without compromise.

The purpose of this manual is to translate abstract values into operational behavior. It
outlines how members must think, decide, and act when representing IBBE—whether
inside a meeting, at a public event, or in the smallest written message. Every sentence,
gesture, and response made in IBBE's name is treated as a statement of our collective
conscience. The aim is not uniformity, but unity—ensuring that each individual acts with
personal authenticity while staying faithful to the moral and operational compass of the
organization.

Its scope extends across the full IBBE ecosystem: Collegium, Convergence, and Clusters.
Every participant in this ecosystem functions as a micro-custodian of IBBE's public trust.
Members are bound to uphold the discipline of communication, the rigor of
documentation, and the cultural standards that define IBBE's global identity. Silence,
inaction, or indifference are considered deviations as serious as misconduct, because
discipline is measured by responsiveness as much as by restraint.

Authority for this manual rests jointly with the Ethics & Compliance Unit (ECU) and the
Brand Integrity Unit (BIU).

- The ECU safeguards ethical judgment, investigates deviations, and administers
restorative actions.
- The BIU preserves the language, visual identity, and representational tone that
shape IBBE's presence in the public domain.

Together, these two units operate as the moral and aesthetic spine of IBBE—ensuring that
conduct remains both correct and characteristic.

This document acts as a living covenant between the organization and its people. It will
evolve as our ecosystem grows, but its essence remains unchanged: discipline without
ego, transparency without excess, loyalty without condition, execution without noise, and
kindness without performance.
