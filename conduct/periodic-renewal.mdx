### 8. Periodic Renewal

Renewal is the mechanism through which IBBE keeps its standards alive. Conduct is not a
one-time declaration — it is a living contract, reaffirmed through discipline. Every member
must periodically recommit to the organization's principles to ensure alignment between
belief and behavior remains current and conscious.

#### Renewal Requirement

All officers, coordinators, and trustees are required to reaffirm their commitment to the
Core Principles of Conduct every six months.

This reaffirmation is completed through the digital signature of Form 2A – IBBE Business
Conduct Charter, accessible exclusively via the internal compliance portal.

By signing, each member confirms:

- Understanding of the latest conduct policies and organizational standards.
- Agreement to uphold the ethical, communicational, and disciplinary expectations
outlined in the Core Principles.
- Acceptance of renewed accountability for response times, tone discipline, and
data confidentiality.

#### Procedure

1. **Automated Notification:**
Renewal reminders are issued fifteen days before the due date through both email
and internal workspace alerts.

2. **Verification Window:**
Officers have seven working days to complete the signing. Any clarification
regarding updated clauses must be addressed to the Ethics & Compliance Unit
(ECU) within this window.

3. **Digital Signature:**
The document is signed using the member's verified internal ID and timestamped
by the system.
The signature serves as both acknowledgment and legal attestation of adherence.

4. **System Integration:**
Once signed, the confirmation syncs automatically to the Compliance Vault,
linking the officer's renewal record to their internal profile.

#### Failure to Renew

Failure to complete renewal within the allotted period leads to immediate temporary
suspension of system access, including email, dashboard, and documentation platforms.

- A single reminder is issued after suspension.
- Continued failure beyond seven additional days is escalated to the Vice President,
People & Culture for compliance review.
- Restoration of access requires signing the overdue form and a written explanation
for the delay.

The renewal process is not punitive — it is preventive. Its purpose is to ensure that every
individual remains consciously aligned with IBBE's ethical core, rather than mechanically
compliant.

#### Compliance Monitoring

The Renewal Compliance Log is maintained within the Compliance Vault and reviewed
quarterly by the ECU.

The log tracks:

- Completion rates per division,
- Delayed responses and causes,
- Trend analysis of departments with recurring lapses.

Division Chiefs receive anonymized summaries for internal accountability training.
Persistent non-compliance triggers leadership review of the division's internal
communication and discipline structure.

#### Philosophy of Renewal

Renewal at IBBE is a ritual of responsibility — a reminder that ethics must be practiced,
not presumed.

The act of signing is symbolic: it reaffirms humility before the mission, loyalty to culture,
and the ongoing choice to uphold integrity without supervision.

To remain part of IBBE is to re-earn that trust every six months, in silence and with
sincerity.
