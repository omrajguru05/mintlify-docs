### 7. Documentation & Recordkeeping

The integrity of IBBE's culture depends on the precision of its records. Every ethical case,
correction, or restoration is documented not to label individuals but to preserve
institutional memory. Recordkeeping transforms discipline into data — enabling the
organization to learn, refine, and prevent recurrence.

#### Case Identification System

Each conduct case receives a unique Compliance Control Unit ID (CCU ID) for
traceability.

Example format: CCU-2025-02-A14, where

- CCU indicates Compliance Control Unit,
- 2025 represents the year,
- 02 signifies the month of registration, and
- A14 is the sequence number of the case within that period.

This code appears in all internal correspondence, ensuring every action can be tracked
without revealing personal identity to unauthorized parties.

#### Storage Protocol: The Compliance Vault

All conduct logs are stored within the Compliance Vault — an encrypted,
access-controlled database integrated into the internal documentation system.

- The vault is housed under the secure infrastructure of docs.ibbe.in, managed by
the Ethics & Compliance Unit (ECU).
- Each entry includes the case ID, date of registration, parties involved, violation
type, stage of ethics cycle, and final resolution status.
- Supplementary materials — such as reflection notes, reports, or communication
excerpts — are stored as encrypted attachments.

Backups are performed weekly and preserved in mirrored repositories across separate
data servers to prevent tampering or loss.

#### Access Hierarchy

Access to the Compliance Vault is strictly limited. Only the following officials may view full
records:

- **President** – Final authority for closure and review.
- **Vice President, People & Culture** – Oversight of behavioral and cultural trends.
- **Chief Compliance Officer (CCO)** – Custodian of the Vault and primary investigator.

Division Chiefs may request anonymized data for training or analysis but cannot view
personal identifiers or private details. Any attempt to access records beyond clearance
level constitutes a major ethical breach.

#### Quarterly Review & Trend Analysis

At the end of each quarter, the ECU compiles a Compliance Summary Report containing:

- Total number of cases registered,
- Category distribution (communication lapse, negligence, tone deviation,
misconduct, etc.),
- Average resolution time,
- Ratio of restoration vs. termination,
- Recurring behavioral or procedural issues observed.

The report is submitted confidentially to the President and Vice President (People &
Culture). Patterns identified in the analysis are used to:

- Update training modules,
- Strengthen preventive guidelines,
- Adjust role expectations and communication protocols.

No personal names or identifying details are included in these summaries. The goal is
institutional learning, not individual judgment.

#### Data Protection Standards

Data within the Compliance Vault is governed by strict internal protection principles:

- **Confidentiality:** All files are visible only to approved personnel with multi-factor
authentication.
- **Integrity:** Each edit is logged with timestamp and user ID. No record can be
deleted; updates create a new revision trail.
- **Retention:** Case files remain archived for five years after closure, after which they
are permanently anonymized.
- **Prohibition of Disclosure:** Sharing any portion of an internal compliance record
outside authorized channels — verbally or digitally — triggers immediate
investigation and may result in disciplinary action.

Every officer handling compliance information must complete annual training in data
protection and sign the Confidentiality & Non-Disclosure Agreement reaffirming legal
and ethical responsibility.

#### Philosophy of Recordkeeping

Documentation at IBBE is not surveillance — it is stewardship. Accurate records protect
both the individual and the institution, ensuring every decision is traceable, fair, and free
from bias. Transparency without exposure, and accountability without spectacle, form the
foundation of IBBE's archival ethics.
