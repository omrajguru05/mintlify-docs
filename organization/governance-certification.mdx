## XI. Governance & Certification

### 1. Mandatory Training

Every officer, cluster founder, and institutional partner must complete role-specific onboarding
and training before assuming official duties.

- Training is assigned via docs.ibbe.in with checkpoints and embedded charter tests.
- For school clubs (Convergence), teachers must complete facilitation training, and
students must complete the Officer Induction Track.
- Institutional partners (Collegium/Cluster schools) must undergo compliance training
during registration.

Failure to complete training invalidates certifications and stalls progressions.

### 2. Renewal & Compliance Logs

Every certified entity within IBBE — including clubs, officers, and partner institutions — must
maintain:

- Quarterly Proof of Work (PoW)
- Audit-friendly activity logs
- Compliance renewals every 6 months (automated reminders will be sent via internal
systems)

Entities that do not submit logs on time are marked for evaluation and may lose:

- Access to docs.ibbe.in
- Authority to represent IBBE
- Eligibility for partner grants and promotions

→ 📄 Internal Docs Compliance Clause

### 3. Institutional Certification

Schools, colleges, or community platforms seeking affiliation with IBBE must:

- Apply through official onboarding pathways
- Undergo verification by the Ethics & Compliance Unit
- Sign a Public Duty & Curriculum Integrity agreement

Once cleared, institutions are granted an IBBE Partner ID and access to:

- Full curriculum toolkits
- Officer training tracks
- Grant eligibility and public listing

Institutions are recertified annually, contingent on student output, ethics, and timely reporting.

### 4. Officer Evaluation

Officer performance is judged not by task volume, but by verifiable transformation.

Evaluations occur across three levels:

- **Internal Flow Compliance** (response time, coordination, reporting)
- **Execution Quality** (impact proof, event strength, outcome clarity)
- **Cultural Alignment** (brand voice, discipline, representation)

Officers who underperform are:

1. Given a correction window
2. Reviewed by their Division Chief
3. Removed or re-assigned if no improvement is seen

Elite officers are promoted to Program Manager, with direct access to board-level meetings
and product shaping discussions.
