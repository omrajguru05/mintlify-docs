## VII. Ethics & Compliance

### 1. Internal Investigations

All reported violations or misconduct undergo a three-stage response cycle:

1. Screening & Fact Check
2. Investigation by Ethics & Compliance Unit
3. Fair Hearing & Final Ruling

Investigations are conducted by the Ethics & Compliance Unit, which operates
independently of all program divisions and reports directly to the President or
Vice-President in serious cases.
All proceedings are documented — and facts, not feelings, drive the outcome.

### 2. Conflict of Interest

Any officer or team member must disclose situations where personal interests could
influence or appear to influence decisions made on behalf of IBBE.

- This includes personal relationships with vendors, clubs, schools, clusters, or
investors.
- Disclosure is expected before action is taken.
- Undisclosed conflicts may result in removal or public correction.

### 3. Disciplinary Actions

Violations are judged on two axes:

- **Damage Caused** (to the system, person, or trust)
- **Recoverability** (whether the trust standard can be restored)

Possible actions include:

- Private Warning
- Suspension from Role or Club
- Loss of IBBE Certification
- Permanent Removal from Ecosystem

The goal is not revenge. The goal is restoration of culture and clarity.

### 4. Appeals Process

Any person who has been suspended, removed, or publicly corrected may appeal
through the following path:

1. Submit written appeal to Compliance Unit
2. Request a formal review by an external ethics reviewer or Vice President
3. Final ruling issued within 7 working days

Appeals are one-time only and must be submitted within 72 hours of the ruling.

→ 📄 Access Appeal Flow

### 5. Confidentiality & Data Handling

All case files, internal complaints, audits, and private communications are handled under
strict confidentiality protocols.

- Data is shared only on a need-to-know basis
- All compliance files are stored in private, access-controlled vaults
- Leaking or sharing internal data leads to immediate disqualification and legal
notice
