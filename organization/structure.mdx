## III. Organizational Structure

### 1. Governance Chain

Co-Founders → Founding Partners → Board-Level Chiefs → Division Chiefs → Directors

Each tier holds defined powers and is held accountable by the one above. No decision
floats without chain-of-command responsibility.

### 2. Co-Founders

Architect of IBBE's internal structure, people systems, and ethical culture.

precision in delivery.

IBBE's conduct policies.
