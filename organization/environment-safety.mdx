## VIII. Environment, Safety & Duty

### 1. Sustainability Standards

All IBBE events, travel, and merchandise must adhere to a basic code of sustainability:

- Plan events using reusable, recyclable, or minimal-resource materials.
- Avoid plastic-heavy, single-use decoration or print.
- Prioritize local sourcing of food, props, and utilities.
- Digital-first default: prefer QR menus, digital kits, reusable forms.

Every division is expected to design for impact, without waste.

### 2. Event Safety Guidelines

Each IBBE event, club session, or field visit must follow basic safety and risk mitigation
protocols:

- Emergency contacts must be logged for all attendees.
- Club coordinators must file a risk assessment note before off-campus activity.
- First-aid kits are mandatory for physical gatherings.
- All partner venues must comply with fire, sanitation, and ventilation safety.

### 3. Public Duty Clause

Every IBBE-certified activity — whether club, cluster, or event — must contribute to
public welfare in a measurable way.

Acceptable forms of contribution include:

- Employment or internships created
- Mental health awareness campaigns
- Student-led public workshops
- Clean design or information systems for local schools
- Fundraising for verified social causes
- Solving inefficiencies in community structures

Public duty is not a slogan. It's an operating standard.

### 4. Measurable Impact Definition

Impact is not marketing reach. It is defined by what changed in the world because you
existed.

IBBE recognizes the following as measurable forms of impact:

- **Reach:** Number of students directly trained, jobs created, funds raised
- **Depth:** Complexity reduced, hours volunteered, clarity added to systems
- **Transferability:** Can someone else use your work to create more change?

Projects are judged not by aesthetics, but effect.
