# EVERYTHING IBBE

## I. Overview

### 1. Definition

International Board of Business Education (IBBE) is an independent global body that
builds and regulates entrepreneurship-based education.
It defines academic, operational, and ethical standards for institutions, educators, and
students who wish to merge business learning with measurable real-world outcomes.
IBBE functions both as a certifying authority and a governing ecosystem, combining
policy, training, and project execution under one unified system.

### 2. Scope of Operations

1. Establishes educational standards through IBBE Collegium.
2. Executes hands-on entrepreneurship programs through IBBE Convergence in schools and
universities.
3. Incubates student-led ventures and collaborations through IBBE Clusters.
4. Oversees corporate, NGO, and government partnerships for internships, CSR, and
innovation initiatives.
5. Maintains centralized digital infrastructure for documentation, training, and governance
across all IBBE entities.

### 3. Legal Identity

IBBE operates as an international educational organization with complete
intellectual-property control over its curriculum, documentation, software systems, and
design assets.
All work produced within the IBBE ecosystem is credited to the creator but legally owned
by IBBE as per internal charter.
Official operations and communication occur exclusively through verified sub-domains
and internal databases.

### 4. Global Recognition

IBBE collaborates with schools, universities, corporates, NGOs, and government bodies
across regions to standardize entrepreneurship education and youth employment
pipelines.
Its dual-framework model—urban premium institutions supported by rural inclusion
programs—creates verifiable social and economic impact recognized by partner
organizations and CSR networks worldwide.
