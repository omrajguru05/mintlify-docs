## VI. Code of Conduct

### 1. Business Conduct Charter

IBBE operates on a zero-fluff, high-integrity discipline system where every action
reflects the brand.
All team members, officers, and cluster leads must follow the official Business Conduct
Charter, which defines how decisions are made, who answers to whom, and what values
are non-negotiable.

→ 📄 Read the Charter

### 2. Core Principles of Conduct

Every officer and cluster member is expected to uphold:

- Discipline without ego
- Transparency without oversharing
- Loyalty to the mission over personal gain
- Execution over explanation
- Kindness without performance

Violations are judged not by apology — but by the restoration of standards.

### 3. Representation Standards

Whether replying to a sponsor, talking to media, or chatting on WhatsApp — you
represent the brand.

- Every communication must follow our Tone & Voice policy.
- Visuals, decks, emails, posters must pass Brand Integrity Unit checks.
- Officers found violating tone or misrepresenting projects may face audit, removal,
or public correction.

### 4. Communication Protocols

IBBE's internal structure demands sharp, timely, and traceable communication.

- Officers must reply to urgent messages within 2 hours.
- All major decisions, updates, and breakdowns must be documented.
- Communication must flow upward and downward via the official hierarchy:

Club Officer → Coordinator → Division Chief → Board Chief → VP → President

→ 📄 Learn Reporting Flow

### 5. Accountability & Collaboration

- All members must hold their 2 direct juniors and 2 direct seniors accountable.
- Collaboration is tracked via internal logs, meeting notes, and public output — not
vibes.
- If performance drops, the system acts — through escalation, replacement, or
reassignment.
