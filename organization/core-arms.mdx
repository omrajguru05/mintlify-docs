## IV. Core Arms of IBBE

### 1. IBBE Collegium

The IBBE Collegium is a full-time institution from Class 1 to 12, governed by IBBE's own
educational board. It replaces all traditional systems (CBSE, ICSE, etc.) and builds
students into strategic operators — fluent in commerce, law, politics, diplomacy, and
systems thinking.

#### a. Curriculum Standards

- Structured in 5 stages:
  1. Survival & Awareness
  2. Society & Structure
  3. Foundations of Power
  4. First Synthesis
  5. Mastery & Command

- Includes military drills, policy simulations, startup cases, negotiation, and
interdisciplinary tasks.

#### b. Certification System

- IBBE conducts ongoing assessment through daily tasks, weekly challenges,
monthly projects, and final simulations.
- Graduates earn IBBE's signature certificate — proving not what they know, but
what they can command in real-world settings.

#### c. Teacher & Institution Training

- IBBE trains institutions in philosophical delivery, interdisciplinary fluency, and
ethical conduct.
- Teachers undergo orientation and continuous upskilling in law, commerce, crisis
management, and diplomacy.

### 2. IBBE Convergence

The Convergence Program is a parallel track delivered through clubs inside existing
CBSE/ICSE/State schools.
It brings IBBE's core philosophy — complexity readiness, interdisciplinary thinking,
leadership training — without replacing the school board.

#### a. School & University Club Model

- Schools host IBBE Clubs that function as micro-startups led by student officers.
- Clubs follow a structured calendar of tasks, leadership meetings, and integrated
simulations.

#### b. Student Officer Roles

- Officer domains include:
  - Finance
  - CSR
  - Legal
  - Politics
  - Diplomacy
  - Media & Design

- Students lead real projects and report to IBBE's Program Managers.

#### c. Program Flow & Evaluation

- Class-wise arc:
  - 1–3: Toy markets, fairness games, light drills
  - 4–6: Mini-elections, debate clubs, early strategy
  - 7–9: Law, politics, commerce clubs, cadet training
  - 10: "Run Your City" simulation, integrated exam
  - 11–12: UPSC & MBA prep, entrepreneurship projects, 3–4 month
specialization

- Students earn dual credentials: school board + IBBE certification.

### 3. IBBE Clusters

Clusters are student-built startups or social innovation projects — created independently
by teens within the IBBE network.
They are not tied to schools, and must prove real-world value to be verified.

#### a. Creation Rules

- Project must be live for at least 2 months
- Minimum 5 defined team members
- Public visibility, documented proof-of-work
- Internal screening by Corporate Relations and Student Affairs

#### b. Trustee System

- Every approved cluster is governed by its Regional Trustee Body
- Trustees manage:
  - Elections
  - Emergency takeovers
  - Discipline
  - Quarterly performance reviews
  - Strategic approvals

#### c. Evaluation & Pitching Process

- Verified clusters pitch before IBBE leadership and investors
- Judged on team structure, problem clarity, roadmap, and value alignment
- Decisions: Approved / Conditional / Rejected with feedback

#### d. Marketing & Partner Benefits

- Media amplification
- Grant access
- Industry networking
- Summit slots
- College/career certification portfolios
- CSR-ready talent pools for corporate partners
