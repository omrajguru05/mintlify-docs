## V. Brand System

### 1. Brand Philosophy

IBBE's brand is not built to impress — it's built to disarm, provoke thought, and earn
trust.
Our branding isn't decoration. It's a weapon. A standard. A signal. Every visual, line, or
color must carry the clarity and tension that our work demands.
IBBE is not youthful by tone, but radically young by spirit. We speak with a mature
calmness, a refusal to overperform, and a deep respect for those willing to build.
We are anti-fluff, anti-clutter, anti-fake. In a world loud with marketing, we speak softly —
because we know what we're building can't be drowned out.

### 2. Tone & Voice Guidelines

As stated in the Business Conduct Policy, every member representing IBBE in public must
follow the official brand tone and narrative:

- **Voice:** Calm, precise, unshakeable. Never robotic. Never dramatic.
- **Language:** Humor is welcome. Wit is respected. Irreverence is allowed. Clarity is
sacred.
- **Storytelling Style:** Narrative-driven. Use real situations, metaphors, or business
analogies. Avoid motivational clichés.
- **Positioning:** We never speak like a brand chasing attention. We speak like a team
building history.
- **Default Style:** "Transform technical challenges into humorous, narrative-driven
storytelling with irreverent charm."

Every officer, whether replying to a sponsor or talking on stage, is considered a live
extension of the brand.

### 3. Design Standards

The design system borrows cues from Apple-like minimalism but avoids all mimicry.
Design must always follow function — no ornamental motion, no noise for style's sake.

- **Typography:** Inter or Montserrat, Black for headings, Medium for body.
- **Color Palette:** Bone, Charcoal, Warm Cream — low contrast, emotionally calm.
- **Motion Language:** GSAP/Three.js powered animations — used only to direct
focus, signify transitions, or teach hierarchy.
- **Imagery:** Custom-drawn minimal graphics, never stock. Every image must feel like
it belongs to a system, not a Canva template.

### 4. Storytelling & Campaigns

IBBE campaigns are always built on narrative intelligence — the ability to tell stories that
last longer than trends.

Stories are designed to:

- Expose flaws in the system
- Frame IBBE as a gentle rebellion
- Connect entrepreneurship to dignity, not greed
- Make invisible effort feel seen

Formats include:

- Short monologues
- Founder's Notes
- Anti-posters (reversing clichés)
- Testimony from inside student clubs
- "Quiet Case Studies" — narratives that show change without shouting it

Every campaign is designed with multi-layered storytelling: something for the reader,
something for the observer, and something for the future.

### 5. "Light Years Ahead" Framework

This is IBBE's flagship brand framework — it positions us not as a competitor to any
school, but as a culture shift that feels like it came from the future.

- **Aesthetic Tone:** Feels 30 years ahead, but deeply rooted in current inequities.
- **Emotional Tone:** Understated, elegant, confident. Never preachy.
- **Functional Role:** "Light Years Ahead" is both a visual campaign and a standards
promise. Anything stamped under this is held to the highest tier of IBBE's
certification and storytelling quality.
- **Use Cases:** Used in flagship announcements, keynote visuals, school revamps,
cluster launches, and digital touchpoints like assets.ibbe.in or shop.ibbe.in.
