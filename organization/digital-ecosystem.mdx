## IX. Digital Ecosystem

### 1. Internal Infrastructure

IBBE operates on a closed-loop digital backbone, built for speed, security, and
scalability.
Most systems are internal-facing and used exclusively by officers, program managers,
and verified partners.

These include:

- **docs.ibbe.in** – Internal documentation library for conduct policies, training
guides, and charters
- **assets.ibbe.in** – Private file vault for logos, templates, legal archives, and PR
decks
- **cdn.ibbe.in** – Backend content delivery system for verified platforms
- **blog.ibbe.in** – Internal editorial vault; campaigns and editions will be released
post-verification
- **urls.ibbe.in** – Custom IBBE URL shortener with tracking access
- **ibbe.shop** – Public storefront for verified handbooks, curriculum kits, and learning
tools

🔒 Note: All internal sites are not open to public users. Links are shared only
when cleared by platform or division managers.

### 2. Data Access Policy

IBBE follows a strict, role-based access model:

- Officers only see what they're working on
- Managers distribute data on a need-to-know basis
- Downloads of internal files are restricted unless flagged as "External Share
Approved"
- No IBBE doc should be circulated outside our ecosystem without watermark and
approval

Breaches are logged, and misuse leads to immediate revocation of role and access keys

### 3. Onboarding & Training Automation

IBBE's onboarding system is being upgraded to run via docs.ibbe.in, with:

- Auto-assigned learning tracks based on officer role
- Built-in progress trackers and milestone reviews
- AI-powered assistant that answers, "Can I do this?" based on our policy logic
- Managers can upload new rolekits and assign mini-certifications inside the system

Goal: New members shouldn't ask what to do. The system should show them.

Only two platforms are currently exposed to the public:

- **ibbe.in** – Public-facing official portal
- **ibbe.shop** – Ecosystem resource store

All others are internal — and will be exposed only when deemed necessary by system
managers or board-level teams.
