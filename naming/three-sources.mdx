## The Three Sources

Every IBBE name is drawn from one of three wells. Choose the well first. Then choose the
name.

### Source One: The Archive

Words that lived in British academic halls, guild charters, royal appointments, and learned
societies before 1800. These words carry centuries of earned weight. They do not need
to be explained. They feel like they were always the right word for the thing.

Use The Archive for: Programs, ranks, credentials, membership tiers, research
designations, and any named offering that signals prestige or academic lineage.

The Archive word bank:

| Word | Origin | Best Used For |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Readership | British academic rank above Lecturer | Research programs, guided scholarly tracks |
| Fellowship | Learned society membership | Competitive, application-based programs |
| Provost | Chief academic officer of a college | Senior internal leadership titles |
| Warden | Governor of an Oxford or Cambridge college | Program oversight roles |
| Licentiate | Licensed practitioner of an art or discipline | Certification upon program completion |
| Annals | Formal record of events or scholarship | Publication series, institutional records |
| Folio | A book of formal collected works | Content collections, published outputs |
| Vellum | The finest manuscript surface, reserved for important documents | Premium credential or certificate tier |
| Charter | A founding document granting rights | Governance documents, founding agreements |
| Ledger | The book of record | Data, reporting, and accountability systems |
| Ordinance | A formal decree or standing rule | Internal policy documents |
| Convocation | A formal assembly of a university body | Events, summits, annual gatherings |
| Matriculant | One who has formally entered an institution | Enrolled student designation |
| Dispensation | A formal exemption or grant | Scholarship or waiver programs |
| Inquest | A formal investigation or inquiry | Internal review processes, audits |
| Compendium | A thorough collection of knowledge | Curriculum libraries, resource collections |
| Quill | The instrument of formal written record | Writing programs, publishing tracks |
| Liege | One who holds formal allegiance | Senior membership tier |
| The Seal | The mark of institutional authentication | Credential stamp, certified designation |
| Cadre | A core trained group | Internal team structure naming |

### Source Two: The Standard

Single declarative nouns. Modern. Heavy. Timeless. These feel like the only possible
name for the thing. They carry no era. They belong to no one. They feel discovered, not
invented.

Use The Standard for: Products, platforms, internal tools, digital systems, and anything
that needs to feel inevitable rather than institutional.

The Standard word bank:

| Word | Feel | Best Used For |
|------|------|---------------|
| Core | Fundamental, central | The main platform or foundational program |
| Basis | The ground everything rests on | Entry-level offering or onboarding system |
| Arc | A trajectory, a journey | Learning pathway or student progress system |
| Mark | A sign of achievement | Credentialing or achievement system |
| Forge | Where things are made hard and real | Practical, hands-on program track |
| Vault | Secured, curated, valuable | Premium content or resource library |
| Atlas | A complete map of a world | Navigation tool, comprehensive curriculum index |
| Lens | A way of seeing clearly | Assessment tool, evaluation framework |
| Meridian | The highest point | Senior program tier or peak credential |
| Apex | The summit | Highest membership or achievement rank |
| Common | Shared, communal, open | Community space or shared resource area |
| Signal | A clear transmission of meaning | Communication or broadcast system |
| Anchor | What holds everything in place | Core curriculum or foundational module |
| Passage | Movement from one state to another | Transition program or onboarding track |
| Prism | Multiple perspectives from one source | Multi-discipline program or cross-functional learning |

### Source Three: The Mark

The IBBE name precedes a single word from The Archive or The Standard. The
combination does the full work. The institution's name lends authority. The second word
lends meaning. Together they feel like a proper noun that has always existed.

Use The Mark for: Any externally facing program, product, or offering where IBBE's name
needs to travel with the thing.

Constructed examples:

| Name | What It Would Be |
|------|------------------|
| IBBE Readership | Research mentorship program |
| IBBE Charter | Founding governance document or governance membership |
| IBBE Forge | Practical, project-based accelerator track |
| IBBE Vault | Premium resource and content library |
| IBBE Licentiate | Certification awarded upon program completion |
| IBBE Convocation | Annual flagship gathering or summit |
| IBBE Atlas | Comprehensive curriculum navigation system |
| IBBE Meridian | Senior leadership or faculty program |
| IBBE Annals | Published research and institutional record series |
| IBBE Common | Open community platform or shared learning space |
| IBBE Folio | Curated collection of student or faculty published work |
| IBBE Seal | The authentication mark on certified credentials |
| IBBE Arc | The student journey and progress tracking system |
| IBBE Lens | Assessment and evaluation framework |
| IBBE Cadre | Internal team or cluster designation system |
