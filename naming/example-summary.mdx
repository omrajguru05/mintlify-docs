## The Internal Rank System: A Worked Example

The IBBE Readership shows how the naming system creates an entire internal language
from one root word.

| Role or Element | Name | Source |
|----------------|------|--------|
| The program itself | IBBE Readership | The Mark |
| Enrolled student | Reader | The Archive |
| Faculty mentor | Senior Reader | The Archive |
| Group track | Reading Group | The Archive |
| Completed credential | IBBE Readership Seal | The Mark + Archive |

Every word stems from one root. The system is self-contained. It requires no external
explanation.

This is the model for every named program inside IBBE. One root word. Every internal
role, group, and credential grows from it.

## Summary

Name from The Archive when the thing needs to feel old, earned, and weighty.

Name from The Standard when the thing needs to feel inevitable, clean, and modern.

Name using The Mark when IBBE's name needs to travel with it.

Always one word. Always passes the three tests. Always feels like it was the only possible
name.

The future belongs to those who build. Name it like it will last.
