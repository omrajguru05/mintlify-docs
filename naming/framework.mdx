# IBBE Naming Framework

The Standard for Naming Everything Inside IBBE

Version 1.0 Internal Reference Document

## Why This Exists

Every name IBBE gives to something is a decision about what that thing means before
anyone uses it. A bad name asks the audience to do work. A good name does the work
for them. A great name makes the thing feel like it always existed.

This document is the rule book. Every program, product, rank, credential, event, or
internal system created inside IBBE gets named using what is written here. No exceptions.

## How the World's Best Companies Name Things

Before the IBBE rules, it helps to understand how the institutions we measure ourselves
against approach naming. The patterns are clear.

Apple names from the physical world. Concrete, familiar, one word. iPhone, iPad,
MacBook, Safari, Finder, Spotlight. The name makes the technology feel human. It never
tries to explain the product. It just gives it a home in the mind. Apple also layers: the
parent brand carries the child name. "Mac" becomes the vessel, and everything inside it
(MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro) inherits its weight without losing its own identity.

Google names by function compressed into one word, or by metaphor. Drive, Maps, Meet,
Docs, Lens, Chrome, Gemini. Most Google names are either exactly what the product
does in a single verb or noun, or they borrow a metaphor that expands the imagination
(Chrome: a layer over the web. Gemini: duality, intelligence). Google also tolerates
invented names when the function is too abstract to be one word.

Amazon names by scale and mythology. Kindle (to ignite). Echo (it listens, it responds).
Alexa (named after the ancient Library of Alexandria). AWS. Prime (the first, the best).
Amazon's names carry ambition. They do not describe the product. They describe what
the product believes about itself.

Stripe and Linear and Notion represent a newer school: single, clean, abstract nouns that
imply motion, structure, and form. Nothing decorative. Everything load-bearing.

McKinsey, Harvard, Oxford name differently entirely. They use rank, lineage, and
institutional language. Fellow. Associate. Visiting Scholar. The Quad. The Press. These
names do not market. They signal belonging to something that preceded you and will
outlast you.

IBBE sits at the intersection of the last two schools. We carry the weight of institutional
language with the cleanliness of modern product naming.
