### Section 3: The Mechanics

**Purpose:** to keep our visual language consistent.

#### 3.1 Grammar & Formatting

- **Lowercase only:** we use strictly lowercase. it feels modern, humble, and
approachable.
  - yes: hello, welcome to ibbe.
  - no: Hello, Welcome to IBBE.
- **Positive contractions:** use "it's," "we're," "you're" to sound natural.
- **Punctuation:** periods are fine. commas let the text breathe. avoid exclamation points
unless it's a genuine celebration.

#### 3.2 Structure

- **Breathable text:** people scan. they rarely read word-for-word. use short sentences.
- **White space:** give the words room to stand out.
