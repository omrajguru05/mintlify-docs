# IBBE & Co

## Verbal Identity System

### Section 1: The Foundation

**Purpose:** to ensure we sound like a helpful human, not a corporation.

#### 1.1 Our Core Purpose

- **The Mission:** we exist to make life simpler and education better by setting a standard
that respects your time and potential.
- **The Audience:** students (10–22) who want a clear path forward without the confusion.
- **The Vibe:** elegant but warm. confident but approachable. a mentor who looks you in
the eye and smiles.

#### 1.2 Brand Persona

- **The Archetype:** the calm architect.
  - we design paths for others to walk. we are quiet because we are confident.
- **Three Pillars:**
  - **Natural:** we speak like people. if you wouldn't say it in a café, we don't write it
here.
  - **Stark:** we value white space. we say only what matters.
  - **Uplifting:** every interaction should leave the student feeling capable and calm.
