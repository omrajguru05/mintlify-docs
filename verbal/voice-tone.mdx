### Section 2: Voice & Tone Application

**Purpose:** to balance premium minimalism with human warmth.

#### 2.1 The Voice Matrix

| Scenario | Tone to Use | Why? |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Marketing | Inviting & fresh | We want them to feel the possibility of what comes next. |
| Errors / friction | Calm & helpful | Things go wrong. We simply fix them together. |
| Support | Kind & patient | We listen first. We ensure they feel heard. |
| Legal / policy | Clear & honest | We use plain language. Trust requires clarity. |

#### 2.2 The "Natural" Shift

**Critical rule:** we strictly avoid negative words. instead of saying what is wrong, we
suggest what is right. this makes us sound helpful rather than restrictive.

| Do This (Natural & Humane) | Avoid This (Robotic or Negative) |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| "this feature is for pro members." | "you can't use this." |
| "let's try that password again." | "incorrect password." |
| "we're here to help you." | "our agents are standing by." |
| "it's best to use a stronger password." | "don't use a weak password." |
| "we prefer to keep things simple." | "we don't like complexity." |
