### 10. Metrics & Reporting

Measurement at IBBE exists to improve culture, not control it. Every quarter, the Ethics &
Compliance Unit compiles a Comprehensive Conduct Report for the Board. Its purpose is
reflection - to track patterns, study progress, and strengthen systems that prevent
recurrence. Numbers are treated as signals of culture, not weapons of oversight.

The report includes five key indicators:

- **Total Cases:** The overall count of reported or identified incidents within the
quarter, segmented by source - complaint, audit flag, or system anomaly.
- **Type Breakdown:** Categorization of each case into ethical, operational,
representational, interpersonal, or security domains. This helps identify where
training, communication, or process design needs reinforcement.
- **Average Resolution Time:** The mean duration between case acknowledgment and
closure, used to ensure speed never compromises fairness.
- **Reinstatement Ratio:** The proportion of members restored after successful
recovery programs, serving as a measure of how well the organization transforms
mistakes into learning.
- **Preventive Actions Implemented:** A summary of new workshops, awareness
sessions, or updated documentation created in response to emerging patterns.

All data is anonymized before presentation. The Board reviews trends quarterly to adjust
policies, update onboarding material, and recalibrate leadership training. The intent is
always developmental - turning each lesson into infrastructure.

Reports are not shared publicly or used for performance ranking. They exist to make the
invisible visible: the tone of the organization, the integrity of its systems, and the
consistency with which it chooses understanding over judgment.

Within IBBE, metrics serve one purpose - to remind leadership that ethics, like innovation,
needs iteration. Each report is not a verdict on people but a mirror of progress, showing
how well the institution is learning to stay human while staying disciplined.
