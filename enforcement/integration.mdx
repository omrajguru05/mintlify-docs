### 11. Integration with Other Policies

The Internal Conduct Restoration & Enforcement Framework does not operate in isolation.
It functions as part of IBBE's larger ecosystem of ethics, culture, and brand discipline.
Each clause connects to a wider network of policies that define how the institution thinks,
builds, and behaves. Together, they create one unbroken moral architecture - a structure
designed to ensure that every correction aligns with the same principles that guide
creation.

This framework directly links to the following governing documents:

- **Business Conduct Charter:** Establishes the philosophical foundation of discipline
at IBBE - authenticity, transparency, and accountability. It defines what conduct
means, how representation extends beyond words, and how discipline restores
rather than punishes.
- **Conflict Disclosure Guidelines:** Clarify expectations for transparency in
partnerships, collaborations, and decision-making. They provide procedure for
declaring relationships or incentives that could influence judgment, ensuring trust
remains verifiable at every level.
- **Privacy Handling Policy:** Outlines the ethical and technical boundaries for
managing confidential information. It governs data access, storage, and
communication standards - forming the procedural backbone of investigation and
recordkeeping within this framework.
- **Brand Integrity Manual:** Defines the emotional and aesthetic tone that must be
preserved even in moments of enforcement. It ensures that language, visuals, and
behavior during disciplinary communication remain consistent with IBBE's public
and internal identity.
- **Role Structure & Expectations:** Describes the chain of accountability across all
levels - from coordinators to trustees. It clarifies who holds authority at each stage
of investigation, who reports to whom, and how discipline flows through hierarchy
without diluting fairness.

Integration across these documents allows IBBE to act as one coherent system - where
every decision, from a warning note to a reinstatement, echoes the same moral intent. By
linking conduct to culture, tone to truth, and enforcement to design, the organization
ensures that order never feels foreign to its values. Every rule, when read together,
becomes not just policy, but proof of the kind of institution IBBE chooses to be.
