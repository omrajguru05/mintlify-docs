### 9. Confidential Recordkeeping

Recordkeeping at IBBE is not a clerical exercise; it is an act of moral accountability. Every
decision, conversation, and correction must leave a verifiable trail - not to control people,
but to protect fairness. The system ensures that memory cannot be rewritten and that
every precedent strengthens the institution's ethical spine.

Each disciplinary case is assigned a unique internal code - for example,
ECC-2025-07-A14 - representing the year, division, and sequence of the event. This code
accompanies every document, transcript, and decision from the first report to the final
closure. The format allows full traceability without revealing personal identities outside
the designated access circle.

All materials are stored securely within the Compliance Vault hosted on docs.ibbe.in.
This vault operates as a closed, encrypted environment monitored by the Ethics &
Compliance Unit. Files are version-locked and time-stamped to ensure no retroactive
editing. Audio, written, and digital evidence are archived in structured layers - summary,
full case record, and attached proof. Each file carries a retention period and is
automatically flagged for review after three years.

Access privileges are deliberately narrow. Only the President, Vice President (People &
Culture), Chief Compliance Officer, and Legal Counsel hold clearance to open complete
case files. Managers or mentors involved in restoration may receive limited, anonymized
access for reflection training, but never full documentation. Any unauthorized attempt to
access or replicate files triggers an automatic compliance alert and audit.

Quarterly, the Ethics & Compliance Unit conducts a pattern review of all case logs. The
goal is not surveillance but learning - identifying recurring behavioral gaps, weak points in
process, or cultural stress indicators. Summarized trends are presented to the Board,
stripped of personal data, to refine training and prevention strategies.

Through this system, IBBE turns recordkeeping into a discipline of trust. Every file
becomes a promise - that truth, once documented, will remain intact; that justice will
always be traceable; and that the institution remembers not to punish, but to evolve.
