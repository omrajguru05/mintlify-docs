### 4. Stages of Disciplinary Action

Discipline at IBBE unfolds through defined stages - each one designed to match the
weight of the act with the precision of response. The intent is never to punish quickly, but
to correct consciously. Every stage builds on the one before it, ensuring fairness,
documentation, and the opportunity for reform.

**Verbal Reflection** is the first step toward restoration. It is an informal but recorded
conversation between the concerned member and their immediate manager. The goal is
awareness, not accusation - to help the individual understand the deviation and its
impact. A short note is logged privately in the compliance tracker to maintain continuity
should similar issues arise again. Example: a coordinator missing a deadline or
mismanaging tone during a meeting may be guided through this stage, followed by a
short reflection summary written by the supervisor.

**Written Advisory** formalizes the concern. It is issued when a pattern emerges or when an
act surpasses the threshold of a simple reminder. The advisory, signed by the reporting
manager and verified by the Ethics & Compliance Unit, outlines the issue, expected
correction, and timeline for review. The member acknowledges receipt and may submit a
brief written response. For example, a repeated failure to report updates or the
unapproved use of IBBE resources triggers this stage. The tone remains factual, and the
emphasis stays on correction, not blame.

**Mediation or Coaching Plan** activates when a matter involves conflict, behavioral friction,
or early signs of cultural strain. The process pairs the member with a senior mentor and
an HR representative for guided sessions. Together, they identify causes, realign
expectations, and design a 30-to-60-day improvement plan. Mediation may also serve as
an alternative to punitive action when both parties demonstrate readiness to rebuild trust.
The progress of this plan is logged weekly in the compliance dashboard.

**Suspension** is a controlled pause, not a verdict. It is used when the nature of the act
threatens organizational order or when previous measures have failed. During
suspension, the member's digital and physical access is frozen, and they undergo
mandatory retraining or counseling before reinstatement. Suspension lasts no longer than
thirty days unless extended by the Ethics & Compliance Unit with written justification. Its
goal is clarity - to separate the person from the pressure, review the facts, and decide the
path forward without haste or bias.

**Termination or Blacklisting** is the final act of accountability. It is applied when trust is
irreparably damaged or when the violation breaches ethical or legal limits. The decision is
made jointly by the Ethics & Compliance Unit and the Board of Trustees. All access is
revoked, dues are settled, and the member's record is archived with documentation of
cause and evidence. If the act involves criminal intent - fraud, harassment, or data theft -
the case is escalated to legal authorities. Blacklisting extends beyond IBBE, restricting
re-entry into any affiliated institution or partner ecosystem.

Each stage carries its own escalation timeline and responsible authority - from
immediate supervisors at the first stage to the Board at the last. Every step is documented
with timestamped notes, ensuring transparency and consistency across departments. The
structure ensures that discipline within IBBE is never impulsive. It is deliberate, traceable,
and restorative - designed to preserve both the standard and the soul of the institution.
