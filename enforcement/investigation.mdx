### 5. Investigation Procedure

Investigations at IBBE are built on clarity, speed, and fairness. Each case is treated as a
matter of institutional integrity, not individual embarrassment. The process ensures that
truth is verified with precision and that every voice is heard before a decision is made.
Every investigation follows a structured pathway, moving from detection to closure with
full documentation.

**Trigger** marks the beginning. A case may arise from a formal complaint, an internal audit
flag, a team report, or an automated alert within the compliance or communication
systems. No concern is dismissed at entry. Even an anonymous message or digital
irregularity triggers an acknowledgment and preliminary review. The origin of a report is
never exposed, protecting both transparency and courage to speak.

**Intake** begins immediately after identification. The Ethics & Compliance Unit
acknowledges the report within twenty-four hours and assigns a reviewing officer or
small team based on the department involved. During this stage, the scope is defined -
what is being examined, who is affected, and what data is required. Communication is
factual and discreet. The member under review is notified only after preliminary screening
confirms the legitimacy of the trigger.

**Fact-Check** is the most methodical phase. Evidence is collected from all relevant sources:
digital records, emails, system logs, financial entries, or firsthand accounts. The reviewing
officer cross-verifies every claim before proceeding. Interviews may be conducted
privately with involved individuals. Each conversation is summarized and stored in
encrypted compliance folders. The tone during this phase is investigative, not adversarial
- the aim is clarity, not confession.

**Hearing** follows once facts are substantiated. The member is invited to a private meeting
with the reviewing officer and a neutral observer from HR. This meeting allows the
individual to present their account in full, respond to evidence, and request additional
review if needed. The conversation is documented verbatim, ensuring that perception
never replaces proof. The hearing ends only when both sides confirm that all information
has been placed on record.

**Decision** occurs after deliberation. The reviewing officer compiles a final report
summarizing findings, intent, and consequence. The report recommends one of four
outcomes: clearance, corrective advisory, suspension, or termination. This
recommendation is reviewed by the Chief Compliance Officer and approved by the Board
or Vice President when required. Decisions must be backed by traceable evidence, not
opinion or hierarchy.

**Archival** closes the process. Once the case is resolved, all documents, recordings, and
communications are encrypted and stored within the compliance vault. Access is limited
to the Ethics & Compliance Unit and board-level auditors for precedent review. Cases are
periodically anonymized and used for internal learning modules, ensuring that past
mistakes serve as future safeguards.

Through this procedure, IBBE ensures that investigation is never an act of accusation but
an act of restoration - a search for truth conducted with discipline, empathy, and
unshakable respect for due process.
