### 7. Appeals Mechanism

The right to appeal is a safeguard of fairness within IBBE's disciplinary system. It exists to
ensure that no decision, however well-intentioned, becomes absolute without review.
Every member retains the right to question, clarify, and seek re-evaluation, provided the
request is made in good faith and within the defined timeframe.

An appeal must be submitted in writing within seven days of receiving the disciplinary
decision. The submission should clearly state the reason for contesting the outcome,
outline any new evidence or context, and propose the form of reconsideration sought.
Emotional argument is discouraged; clarity of fact and reasoning carry greater weight.

All appeals are jointly reviewed by the Vice President (People & Culture) and one
independent Trustee unaffiliated with the case. Their role is not to overturn decisions
reflexively but to ensure that procedure, fairness, and proportionality were upheld during
the initial investigation. When necessary, they may request additional documentation or
re-interview relevant parties before reaching a conclusion.

The final ruling is documented in the compliance archive and communicated formally to
the member. Outcomes may affirm, modify, or overturn the original decision. Once
concluded, the ruling is considered binding. Every quarter, anonymized precedents from
appeals are compiled by the Ethics & Compliance Unit and reviewed by the Board to
refine enforcement practices and strengthen institutional learning.

This mechanism protects both justice and humility within IBBE. It guarantees that every
judgment remains open to reflection - proving that authority here is guided by
conscience, not ego.
