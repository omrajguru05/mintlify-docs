### 6. Recovery & Reintegration

Restoration within IBBE is a deliberate process - a bridge between failure and renewal.
When a member's action is found to be non-malicious and recoverable, the focus shifts
from enforcement to education. The goal is not to erase the mistake but to ensure it never
repeats. Reintegration becomes both an act of learning and a reaffirmation of the values
that define the institution.

**Reflection Report** marks the beginning of recovery. The member writes a detailed
account explaining the circumstances of the breach, what principles were compromised,
and how they plan to rebuild trust. This is not a formality; it is a personal audit. The report
is reviewed by the immediate manager and the Ethics & Compliance Unit to confirm that
understanding has turned into accountability.

**Mentorship Period** follows as a structured re-entry phase. For thirty to ninety days, the
member works under the supervision of a senior mentor assigned by the People & Culture
Division. Together, they design measurable correction goals - communication habits,
timely reporting, tone discipline, or task reliability. Weekly check-ins track progress, and
the mentor's observations become part of the recovery file. The intent is to convert
insight into behavior, ensuring growth is proven, not declared.

**Re-Certification** ensures renewed competence in IBBE's ethical and operational
standards. The member must complete core training modules on ethics, data protection,
and brand communication, followed by a short assessment. Successful completion
reinstates their eligibility for access credentials and leadership responsibilities. This step
re-anchors the person in the organization's moral and procedural framework.

**Cultural Interview** serves as the final checkpoint. Conducted by the People & Culture
Division, it evaluates readiness beyond compliance - tone, humility, and consistency of
conduct. The session is conversational rather than evaluative, designed to confirm that
reflection has matured into integrity. Once cleared, the reinstatement notice is issued
jointly by People & Culture and the Ethics & Compliance Unit.

Recovery and reintegration are treated as privileges earned through sincerity. A restored
member is never marked by their mistake but by their response to it. The process exists to
ensure that discipline does not end careers but strengthens character - proving that
within IBBE, redemption is not granted by hierarchy, but achieved through accountability
and growth.
