### 8. Communication Protocol

In matters of conduct and enforcement, language defines culture. IBBE's communication
during disciplinary or restorative proceedings must reflect the same restraint and dignity
that govern its public voice. Every word carries moral weight; therefore, communication is
treated as a function of ethics, not administration.

Tone remains factual, dry, and internally compassionate. Every message should convey
clarity without embellishment - an account of what occurred, what is being done, and
what comes next. There is no space for dramatization, exaggeration, or speculation.
Emotion is not a tool; precision is. The goal is to create understanding, not tension.

No naming or shaming is permitted at any stage. Internal updates may refer to roles or
departments, but never to personal identities outside the immediate chain of command.
Public communication on disciplinary matters is strictly prohibited unless approved by the
Board, and even then, it must focus on the principle, not the person. Privacy is considered
an ethical right, not a favor.

To ensure consistency, the Ethics & Compliance Unit provides official templates for all
sensitive communication. These include:

- **Case Acknowledgment:** Confirms receipt of a report or complaint, outlines the
next procedural steps, and assures confidentiality.
- **Advisory Notice:** States the observed concern, expected correction, and response
timeline in neutral language.
- **Reinstatement Confirmation:** Documents successful recovery, closure of the
case, and reinstatement terms - signaling that the individual is again in good
standing.
- **Appeal Outcome:** Communicates the final decision after review, referencing
evidence and reasoning while maintaining composure and brevity.

Every template is pre-reviewed by the Brand Integrity Unit to ensure alignment with
IBBE's narrative tone - factual, calm, and free of bias. No communication leaves the
compliance channel without this review.

In IBBE, the way truth is spoken is as important as the truth itself. The discipline of tone
ensures that even in correction, the organization sounds like what it stands for: measured,
human, and quietly just.
