### 12. Closure & Signature

The framework closes where accountability begins - with acknowledgment. Every
member of IBBE, regardless of position or tenure, is required to re-sign the Business
Conduct Charter every six months. This act is more than a procedural renewal; it is a
reaffirmation of belonging to a system built on integrity.

By signing, each individual confirms their understanding of four essential commitments:

- **Enforcement Hierarchy:** Awareness of how authority flows during disciplinary
processes, and respect for the structure that protects fairness across every level.
- **Right to Appeal:** Recognition that every decision may be reviewed, ensuring justice
remains dynamic and open to correction.
- **Data Confidentiality Obligations:** Acceptance of full responsibility for protecting
all internal information - written, digital, or spoken - as a matter of trust and
legality.
- **Brand Language Compliance:** Agreement to communicate with precision,
restraint, and humanity, ensuring that every message reflects the organization's
voice and values.

Completion of this acknowledgment renews digital access, certification validity, and
leadership eligibility. Refusal or neglect to sign automatically pauses all privileges until
compliance is restored.

Through this closing ritual, IBBE ensures that every name on its roster carries both
accountability and alignment. It is a quiet signature of conscience - a reminder that
discipline, trust, and tone are shared duties, renewed in writing so that the institution's
ethics never fade into assumption.
