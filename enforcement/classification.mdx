### 3. Classification of Violations

IBBE recognizes that wrongdoing can take infinite forms - from small lapses of judgment
to actions with severe moral or legal consequence. Every act is measured by three lenses:
intent, impact, and recoverability. The purpose is not to catalogue punishment but to
build a framework where no breach, however grave, escapes clarity - and no human,
however flawed, is denied fairness.

**Ethical Violations** strike at the conscience of the organization. These include dishonesty,
data falsification, bribery, plagiarism, impersonation, favoritism, or any attempt to
manipulate results or perception. Extortion, fraud, or deliberate misinformation in public
statements also belong here. Even moral misconduct outside official duties - such as
harassment, exploitation, or participation in illegal trade - is subject to review when it
compromises IBBE's integrity. The response is immediate isolation of access, full
investigation, and submission to relevant legal authorities where required. If the act is
recoverable through accountability and reform, restoration follows under a monitored
probation. If not, permanent removal and public distancing are executed to protect the
ecosystem.

**Operational Violations** concern the failure of duty. These span from persistent
unresponsiveness and chronic underperformance to misuse of institutional tools, financial
mismanagement, and intentional obstruction of team progress. In extreme cases, it
extends to internal sabotage, document tampering, or resource theft. The initial response
is documentation of evidence, performance review, and direct mediation. Repeated
offenses lead to suspension, replacement, and in cases of financial or digital fraud, legal
escalation. Operational integrity is not about productivity; it is about trust in execution.

**Representational Violations** distort how IBBE is perceived by the public. They include
off-brand statements, unauthorized interviews, false claims of association, tone breaches
in communication, defamation of colleagues, or use of IBBE's name in personal ventures.
Any manipulation of media, AI-generated impersonations, or digital slander also falls
under this category. The immediate response is removal of content, public correction, and
formal advisory. Repeat offenses or deliberate distortion result in blacklisting and brand
disassociation. Representation is treated as sacred territory - when one speaks as IBBE,
they speak for every life touched by it.

**Interpersonal Violations** involve harm between people. These include disrespect,
bullying, intimidation, exclusion, gossip, discrimination, emotional manipulation, or any
form of harassment - verbal, psychological, or physical. It also extends to stalking,
coercion, blackmail, and abuse of emotional or professional power. In such cases,
empathy training and restorative sessions are the first step. When the harm is deliberate
or severe, the process moves toward suspension, external reporting, and full protection
for the victim. The system sides with truth and safety, never with hierarchy.

**Security and Confidentiality Violations** cover every act that endangers internal stability -
hacking, leaks, unauthorized data access, or external sharing of private files. It also
includes digital misconduct such as password theft, system intrusion, or the creation of
shadow communication groups to evade oversight. In high-risk cases, such as sabotage,
stalking, or espionage, response includes immediate deactivation of accounts,
cyber-forensic audit, and collaboration with law enforcement. For lesser offenses -
accidental exposure or poor security practice - the response includes retraining and
monitored reinstatement.

Beyond these, IBBE addresses **Criminal or Extraordinary Violations** - acts that break civil,
cyber, or human law. These include fraud, physical assault, sexual misconduct, hate
crimes, discrimination, or exploitation of minors. IBBE does not shield such acts under
institutional process. Once verified, they are escalated directly to external authorities
while the individual's association is revoked. Internally, the event is documented as
precedent to strengthen prevention systems.

The reaction to any act - whether a missed task or a felony - follows a single truth:
accountability first, dignity always. For minor infractions, education precedes punishment.
For complex ethical cases, restoration is conditional upon demonstrated change. For
crimes that breach moral or legal ground, IBBE aligns fully with law enforcement while
maintaining internal respect for due process. No punishment is public, no forgiveness is
automatic, and no silence is tolerated.

This classification ensures that IBBE's moral architecture is complete - capable of
handling anything from a careless word to a calculated crime. The aim is not control
through fear, but order through conscience. The world may carry infinite forms of
wrongdoing; within IBBE, they all meet the same test - clarity, fairness, and the possibility
of becoming better after being wrong.
