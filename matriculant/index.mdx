## What it is

ibbe matriculant is the official process every idea at ibbe must pass through before it becomes a product, a feature, or an initiative. it is a two-stage framework built to protect the organisation from two familiar traps: moving forward on something that has no business logic, and spending months planning something that never feels real to the people it is meant to serve.

matriculant is the gateway. every idea that carries the ibbe name earns that right here first.

## Why it matters

we respect time. at ibbe, time is not a resource we spend freely — it is one we invest with intention. matriculant exists because enthusiasm without structure produces work that looks confident but solves nothing. and structure without imagination produces plans that read well but feel hollow.

this process closes that gap. it asks every idea to prove itself in writing before it is visualised, and to prove itself visually before it is built. when both stages are passed, what comes out the other side is something the team believes in, leadership can stand behind, and students will actually use.

this is how ibbe builds things the right way.

---

## Stage 1: The Logic

before anyone opens a design tool or writes a single line of code, the idea must exist on one page. this is called the one-page press release.

the press release is written exactly as a student or partner would read it on the day the idea launches. if the value of the idea is unclear in three paragraphs, the idea is returned for refinement. this is a feature, not a flaw. clarity at this stage saves months of misaligned effort later.

alongside the press release, the originator writes the hard truth faq — five of the most difficult questions the idea will face. these are the questions a thoughtful critic would ask. for a platform like learn.ibbe.in, this might mean asking why a student would choose this over a free resource available elsewhere, or how the system performs under real usage load. writing honest answers to hard questions is not a formality. it is the work.

the logic stage is the responsibility of the department chief whose scope the idea falls under. it is reviewed before anything moves forward.

---

## Stage 2: The Magic

once the logic is approved, the idea enters the pixel phase. here, the focus shifts from what the idea is to how it feels.

rather than building the entire system, the team identifies one hero feature — the single interaction that best represents the idea's value. this might be the checkout experience, the progress tracker, or the first screen a student sees after signing up.

the team begins with ten rough approaches to that one interaction. they select the best three to develop further. from those three, one high-fidelity prototype is built. it should look and feel like the finished product — even if the technology behind it is entirely simulated. the goal is not to deceive. the goal is to make the idea real enough that a student, a partner, or a member of senior leadership can experience it honestly.

at ibbe, a pitch is ready when someone can feel it — before the backend exists.

---

## Why this works

**clarity.** the written stage forces every originator to think through the education logic, the student journey, and the commercial case before a single design decision is made.

**excitement.** the visual stage transforms a good idea into something people can believe in. leadership, collaborators, and future partners respond to things they can experience — not just read.

**speed.** this process removes both extremes. it protects the team from over-documenting ideas that should be prototyped, and from over-designing ideas that have no business case. the result is faster movement with fewer reversals.

## The IBBE Matriculant Pitch Template

every idea submitted through matriculant follows this structure:

| step | format | goal |
|---|---|---|
| 1. the hook | one-page press release | define the "why" |
| 2. the proof | five-question internal faq | define the "how" |
| 3. the wow | one high-fidelity prototype | define the "experience" |

## A note to every member

matriculant is a standard, not a barrier. it exists because the ideas worth building deserve the structure that makes them real. if your idea is strong, this process will make it stronger. if it has gaps, this process will surface them early — when they are still easy to fix.

bring your best thinking. the process will take care of the rest.
