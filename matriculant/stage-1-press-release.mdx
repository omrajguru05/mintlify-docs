### The Headline

Write one sentence that captures the entire idea. If a student read only this line, they should understand what this is and why it matters.

> [Your headline here]

### The Problem

Describe the gap this idea fills. What is the student currently experiencing that this idea improves? Write this in plain language — the way you would explain it to someone outside ibbe.

> [Two to three sentences. Be specific. Avoid broad generalisations.]

### The Solution

Describe what this idea does and how it works for the student. Focus on the experience, not the technology. What does the student see, feel, or gain?

> [Two to three sentences. Keep it simple and human.]

### The Value

Why does this matter at ibbe specifically? How does it serve our standard — respecting the student's time and potential? What changes for them after this exists?

> [Two to three sentences. Connect the idea to ibbe's purpose.]

### The Launch Moment

Write exactly what a student or partner would read on the day this goes live. This could be a homepage headline, an in-app message, or an announcement. Make it feel real.

> [Your launch copy here — written as the student would see it]
