This document guides the pixel phase. It is completed after stage 1 is approved. Its purpose is to focus the team on one hero feature and produce a prototype that feels like the finished product—before the full system is built.

### The Hero Feature

Identify the single interaction that best represents the value of this idea. This is the moment a student experiences the idea for the first time and understands why it exists.

**Hero Feature Name:**  
> [One clear name for the feature — e.g. "the progress tracker" or "the first lesson experience"]

**Why this feature:**  
> [Two to three sentences. Explain why this specific interaction was chosen over others. What does it reveal about the idea's core value?]

### The 10 Approaches

Before moving to design, list ten distinct ways this hero feature could work. These are rough ideas — sketches in words. The goal is breadth, not polish.

1. [approach]
2. [approach]
3. [approach]
4. [approach]
5. [approach]
6. [approach]
7. [approach]
8. [approach]
9. [approach]
10. [approach]

### The 3 Selected

From the ten above, identify the three approaches worth developing further. For each, write one sentence on why it made the cut.

**Option A:**  
> [Name and one sentence on why it was selected]

**Option B:**  
> [Name and one sentence on why it was selected]

**Option C:**  
> [Name and one sentence on why it was selected]

### The Chosen Direction

From the three options, identify the one the team is building as a high-fidelity prototype. This is the direction that moves forward.

**Chosen Option:**  
> [Option A, B, or C — and the reason it was selected over the others]

### The Prototype Specification

Describe what the prototype must include for it to pass the feel test. Be specific about what the student sees, clicks, and experiences.

**Screens or states to include:**  
> [List each screen, state, or interaction the prototype covers]

**What it must feel like:**  
> [Two to three sentences. Describe the emotional experience of moving through the prototype. calm? clear? exciting? grounding?]

**What it does not need to include:**  
> [List anything intentionally excluded from the prototype — back-end functionality, edge cases, secondary flows, etc.]

### The Feel Test

The prototype is ready when someone outside the team can experience it and understand the idea without explanation. Use these questions to evaluate it before submission.

- Does the prototype look and feel like the finished product?
- Would a student understand what this is within the first ten seconds?
- Does it reflect IBBE's standard — calm, clear, and respectful of the student's time?
- Would a member of senior leadership be able to present this confidently?

**Feel Test Conducted By:** [Name]  
**Feel Test Date:** [Date]  
**Outcome:** [ Ready to Submit ] / [ Returned for Refinement ]  

### Prototype Submission

Attach or link the final prototype file below. All prototypes must be reviewed and approved by the department chief before the idea advances to the build phase.

**Prototype file or link:** [Link]  
**Submitted To:** [Name]  
**Submission Date:** [Date]

*Stage 2 is complete when the prototype passes the feel test and receives department chief approval. The idea is then ready to enter the build pipeline.*
