### 6. The Trust Mechanism

#### Reporting

Every member has the right to speak - and the organization has the duty to listen. Ethical
concerns, misconduct, or boundary violations may be reported through the official
channels introduced during training. These channels are designed to be clear, accessible,
and non-hierarchical. If something feels wrong, speak. Silence is not professionalism - it
is permission.

#### Confidentiality

All reports are handled discreetly and respectfully. Names are protected. Retaliation is
prohibited. Reporting a concern in good faith will never be punished - no matter the
outcome. Trust cannot exist without safety; confidentiality ensures that safety is real, not
performative.

#### Fairness

Every report is reviewed by IBBE's Ethics & Compliance Unit. Investigations are impartial
and methodical. All parties are given the opportunity to be heard. No decision is made
without context. Fairness is not just a value - it is a process, repeated with care every
time.

#### Breach of Trust

When trust is broken, the response is scaled to the severity of the breach. Disciplinary
action may include:

- Verbal notice (a learning moment)
- Written advisory (a formal correction)
- Temporary suspension (a reflection period)
- Termination (final action)

The goal is not punishment, but the restoration of standards. Every step is documented.
Every decision must survive sunlight.
