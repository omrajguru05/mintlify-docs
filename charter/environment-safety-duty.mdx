### 10. Environment, Safety & Public Duty

#### Sustainability

Every decision at IBBE must leave the world lighter than it was before. Events must avoid
single-use plastic, encourage shared transport, and remain fully paperless wherever
possible. We design for efficiency, not excess. Even in celebration, we remain conscious
of impact. Protecting nature is not a campaign - it's a default setting.

#### Health & Safety

Every IBBE space - digital or physical - must uphold basic safety. In-person events
require first-aid kits, verified attendance caps, and documented checklists reviewed by
the Sustainability & Impact Integrity Unit (SIIU). Risk is not drama; it is data. Safety is not
decoration; it is structure.

#### Public Duty

Every IBBE activity must produce measurable benefit. Not likes, not reach - but
improvement.

Measurable impact is the tangible evidence of value created - the point
where intention transforms into visible improvement in people's lives,
institutions, and communities.

We measure our success in complexity removed, opportunities opened, systems
stabilized, and futures made more possible. Whether it's one student or one city, the
metric remains unchanged: lives improved, transparently and truly.
