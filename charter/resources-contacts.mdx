### 13. Resources & Contacts

The following support channels are available to all members of IBBE. Specific email
addresses, contact forms, and access instructions will be shared during training and
onboarding.

- **Compliance Officer**
For reporting violations, breaches, or ethical concerns.

- **HR & Ethics Desk**
For questions about training, conduct, culture, or team dynamics.

- **Legal Counsel**
For matters involving contracts, partnerships, or legal obligations.

- **Anonymous Reporting Channel**
For submitting sensitive concerns discreetly, with confidentiality guaranteed.

All channels are active, monitored, and bound by institutional duty of care. Use them not
just when something breaks, but when something doesn't feel right.
