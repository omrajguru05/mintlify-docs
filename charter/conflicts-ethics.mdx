### 5. Conflicts, Ethics, and Representation

#### Conflict of Interest

Personal or financial interests that could bias judgment must be disclosed before
decisions are made. Relationships, roles, or incentives that may compromise clarity - even
unintentionally - must be surfaced early. Conflicts are not violations, but hiding them is.
Disclosures are reviewed by the Chief People Officer and Chief Compliance Officer with
confidentiality and fairness.

#### Gifts & Hospitality

You may accept personal gifts or hospitality worth up to ₹2,000. Anything above must be
declared and formally approved. This rule applies to every officer - full-time or student -
across all departments. The purpose is not to restrict kindness, but to preserve neutrality.
We judge opportunities on merit, not memory.

#### Startups & Ventures

IBBE encourages external ventures - as long as they do not compromise the quality of
results within IBBE. Members may pursue startups, freelance roles, or creative projects
without seeking approval, but must inform their department head prior to engagement.
Ventures that interfere with deliverables, deadlines, or the integrity of IBBE's work will be
addressed with direct feedback and support-based course correction.

#### Media & Public Representation

No member speaks on behalf of IBBE without approval. All public appearances,
interviews, podcasts, panels, and published content that reference IBBE - directly or
indirectly - must be cleared by the Chief Press Officer or a Co-Founder. No internal
information may be revealed before its intended launch. Even casual interactions - if
recorded, shared, or broadcast - are expected to reflect IBBE's tone: humorous,
narrative-driven, and irreverently precise. Every employee is a living extension of the
brand. The camera doesn't create that - it only reveals it.

#### Financial Integrity

No IBBE resource - digital, physical, or intellectual - may be used for personal gain. This
includes but is not limited to: software logins, team subscriptions, Airtable bases, email
credits, design templates, or marketing tools. Every tool inside IBBE exists to serve the
mission, not individual convenience. Use is a privilege, not a perk.
