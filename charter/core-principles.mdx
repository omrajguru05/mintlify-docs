### 2. Core Principles of Conduct

Every action at IBBE reflects a belief. Every belief demands conduct that proves it.
These principles define how we work, speak, and decide - wherever we are.

1. **Authenticity**
We tell the truth even when silence would sell faster. Our words must match our
intent.

2. **Transparency**
No hidden agendas. No artificial optics. We say what we mean and we document
what we say.

3. **Service**
Business is a public duty. Every project, partnership, and event must improve
something real in the world.

4. **Excellence**
Precision is a form of respect. Every task - from an email to a summit - must meet
a standard we can sign our name under.

5. **Respect**
For time, for people, for institutions. Respect is not politeness; it is consistency
under pressure.

6. **Belief**
An employee is not separate from the brand; they are its living embodiment. Every
interaction - spoken or unspoken - carries what IBBE stands for. When one of us
steps into the world, the brand steps with us.

7. **Integrity**
We choose what is right over what is easy. No exceptions. No borrowed ethics.
