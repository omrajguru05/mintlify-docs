### 12. Enforcement & Appeals

#### Disciplinary Framework

All violations are addressed with measured consequence. Based on severity, the Ethics &
Compliance Unit may issue:

- Written warning (documented notice of breach)
- Mediation (guided reconciliation process)
- Temporary suspension (pause in duties or access)
- Expulsion (removal from position or the organization)

Every action is guided by evidence, context, and IBBE's internal code.

#### Right to Appeal

Any member has the right to request a formal review of disciplinary action within 7 days
of receiving notice. Appeals must be submitted in writing. All reviews are conducted by
the Ethics & Compliance Unit, whose decision is final. While verdicts are shared, internal
case documentation and deliberation notes remain confidential to preserve investigative
integrity.

#### Documentation

Every case - including findings, outcomes, and appeals - is documented securely. These
records are kept for internal learning, precedent alignment, and governance consistency.
Discipline is not about control; it is about continuity.
