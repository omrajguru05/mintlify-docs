# IBBE Business Conduct Charter

A covenant of how we exist, build, and behave.

### 1. Preamble: The Way We Exist

IBBE was created to make education right - in quality, in accountability, and in use.
We exist to prove that education can be both principled and practical, that learning should
build competence, not confusion.

We believe trust is the foundation of every idea that carries our name.

Business comes before service, and service earns its worth through the excellence of
that business.

We do things the right way - even when the right way is harder, slower, or lonelier.

IBBE stands for honesty in every transaction, respect in every interaction, and precision in
every decision.

We hold ourselves accountable to the same standards we expect from others: clarity,
ethics, and execution without shortcuts.

We do not rent our attention. IBBE will never host third-party advertisements or paid
promotions.

Our work must speak from purpose, not persuasion. Every word, image, and partnership
must preserve the clarity that defines us.

We measure success not by scale, but by consequence - whether our work leaves a
positive, productive impact on the lives it touches.

We exist to demonstrate that business can and must be a force for good. To educate,
employ, and empower - responsibly, transparently, and with conscience.

When one of us steps into the world, IBBE steps with them: calm in tone, exact in truth,
and unwavering in principle.
