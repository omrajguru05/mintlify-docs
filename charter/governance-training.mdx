### 11. Governance, Training & Certification

#### Mandatory Training

Every officer - regardless of role, seniority, or department - is required to complete
onboarding training in three core areas: ethics, data protection, and event safety. Training
is delivered either live via video call or in-person depending on job location. All members
must also read the official IBBE documentation, accessible through internal links.
Attendance is logged. Completion is not optional.

#### Certification

Every six months, all officers must renew their compliance acknowledgment by re-signing
the IBBE Charter. This process is fully automated and time-bound. Failure to complete
renewal on schedule will trigger a temporary access freeze until resolved.

#### Governance Chain

IBBE's authority structure is clear:

Co-Founders → Founding Partners → Chiefs → Directors → Program-Specific
Managers → Officers → Coordinators

Each level is accountable to the one above - and responsible for the one below. In cluster
operations, governance is guided by the trustee structure outlined in the IBBE Clusters
Charter.

#### Documentation

Training records, compliance logs, and policy acknowledgments are jointly maintained by
the Human Resources Department and the Ethics & Compliance Unit. All records are
confidential, timestamped, and stored within the IBBE internal database. The goal is
traceability - not surveillance.
