### 3. Responsibilities of Every Member

Every member of IBBE carries the brand in their conduct. The standard is not decorative -
it defines how we work, speak, and decide. Responsibility begins with self-discipline and
ends with trust earned through consistency.

#### Representation

Each officer, coordinator, and leader represents more than a title. The world meets IBBE
through their tone, patience, and precision. Speak with restraint. Act with clarity. In every
public space - from a classroom to a boardroom - embodies calm. When you speak, the
organization's integrity travels with your words.

#### Partnerships

Transparency is our operating language. All collaborations must be documented and
approved before execution. No verbal agreements, no private deals. Every interaction
with schools, corporates, NGOs, or media partners must reflect fairness and clarity. We
partner to serve communities, not to leverage them.

#### Confidentiality

Information is a form of trust. Handle it with deliberate care. Data, visuals, or project
details must stay within IBBE until cleared by the chief of the relevant department.
Nothing leaves the organization before its decided launch date. Every draft, design, and
document carries a timeline - respect it as you would a signature.

#### Reporting Issues

If something violates IBBE's standard, report it - firmly, privately, and without theatrics.
The goal is resolution, not spectacle. Concerns raised in good faith will be treated with
respect and confidentiality. Our measure of maturity is how calmly we respond when
things go wrong.

#### Decision Hierarchy

Responsibility flows upward, but clarity flows both ways. Department Chiefs decide
operational timelines and approvals. Trustees and Co-Founders define vision and final
direction. Every member is expected to know where authority ends and accountability
begins. Response time is part of respect - delays without communication erode trust.

#### Conduct in Practice

Members are expected to align decisions with IBBE's founding principle: business as
service. Each action should add measurable value - to people, to processes, or to
perception. The emotional tone of work should remain professional and unmanipulative.
Leadership at IBBE is quiet, exact, and earned through behavior, not titles.
