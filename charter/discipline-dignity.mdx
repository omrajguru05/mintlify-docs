### 9. Discipline and Dignity

#### Definition of Violation

A violation is any act - intentional or careless - that compromises IBBE's integrity, trust, or
reputation. It may involve breaches of confidentiality, unethical behavior, resource
misuse, public misrepresentation, or failure to uphold expected standards. The measure
isn't harm done - it's trust lost.

#### Process

All violations are reviewed by the Ethics and Compliance Unit. The process is simple:
investigation, fair hearing, measured response. Every individual has the right to be heard.
Every case is judged in full context. Discipline is not reaction - it is restoration.

#### Language

All communication during the disciplinary process must follow IBBE's official brand
language: humorous, narrative-driven storytelling with irreverent charm - even when the
matter is serious. Emotion is never weaponized. Words are never used to shame. The tone
remains factual, respectful, and human - always.

#### Objective

The goal of discipline is not punishment, but the restoration of standards. Wherever
possible, members are supported through reflection and learning.

Consequences may include:

- Verbal reflection
- Written advisory
- Temporary suspension
- Termination

All disciplinary actions are kept private. There is no public record, no shaming, no display.
If a violation is deemed forgivable, the Ethics and Compliance Unit may - at its discretion -
allow a member to return, provided accountability is accepted and change is
demonstrated.
