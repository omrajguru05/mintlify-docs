### 8. Digital and Confidential Information

#### Data Handling

Every byte of information inside IBBE - whether personal, academic, strategic, or
operational - is treated as sensitive. Data is not just numbers or text; it's trust made
tangible. Officers and members may only access what their role requires. No one has the
right to browse, view, or forward files outside their scope, even out of curiosity.
Need-to-know is not secrecy - it's security.

#### Intellectual Property

Any work created within IBBE - decks, documents, tools, curriculums, visuals - is owned
by the organization. Creators retain authorship credit, but the rights belong to IBBE. If a
member wishes to use their contributions in portfolios or external platforms, prior written
approval is required. This protects both the creator's credit and the organization's
integrity.

#### Information Access

Documents, dashboards, and communication tools must remain within IBBE's internal
ecosystem. Downloading materials to personal devices, sharing links externally, or
duplicating files outside approved platforms is strictly prohibited. Every officer is
expected to operate within the boundaries of their department's systems. Platform
integrity is part of operational excellence.

#### Privacy

Privacy is a core standard of respect. Internal conversations, documents, messages, or
team dynamics are never to be published, shared, or paraphrased in public without
written approval. Screenshots, quotes, or personal observations - even if well-intended -
require clearance. Every member is entitled to clarity on what stays private, and
confidence that what happens within IBBE stays within IBBE.
