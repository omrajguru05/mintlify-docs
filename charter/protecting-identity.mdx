### 7. Protecting IBBE's Identity

#### Logo & Visuals

The IBBE identity - our logo, mark, and design language - may only be used by
pre-approved teams and clusters. All creative materials must follow official templates and
adhere to the brand kit shared during training. Unauthorized edits, visual distortions, or
informal recreations are prohibited. Every design decision reflects the seriousness of the
institution - we don't improvise the face of the brand.

#### Media

All content that carries IBBE's name - visual, written, journalistic, or cinematic - must align
with our narrative tone: humorous, storytelling-driven, and irreverently precise. Nothing
may be published publicly without prior review and sign-off from the Brand Integrity Unit.
Whether it's a YouTube description or a campaign poster, the rule is the same: if it carries
our name, it carries our standard.

#### Social Media

IBBE may be mentioned on personal social accounts, but every mention must maintain
clarity, restraint, and alignment with official brand voice. Members may not use informal
tone, slang, or unapproved hashtags when referencing IBBE. No matter how small the
post, it must be treated as a public-facing extension of the brand. The platform may be
casual; the conduct is not.

#### AI-Generated & Public-Facing Content

No AI-generated content may be published under IBBE's name - not text, not images, not
video. Creativity must come from human intent, shaped through institutional review.
Content produced using tools like ChatGPT, Veo, Midjourney, or any generative AI must
remain internal unless explicitly cleared by the Brand Integrity Unit. Our voice is
handcrafted - and it must feel that way.
